            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Gentleman was no leſs aſtoniſht to hear theſe Words, than to ſee him that ſpake them, towards whom he diligently haſtned to free him from the Danger he was in. The Lion no ſooner ſaw him approach, but letting go the Child, he went to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman notwithſtanding got quickly up again, and recharging the Lion, wounded him with a back-blow ſo deep into the Reins, that one might have ſeen his Entrals, the Beaſt immediately falling dead on the Graſs. The Gentleman then lookt about to ſee what was become of the Child he had ſuccour'd, and ſpying him run away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long a Path, made after him, that he might get him to declare what knowledge he had of him.

               <p>Then the King, commanding <hi>Maudan</hi> to keep ſecret what he had told him, retir'd to his Chamber as full of diſcontent, as the Villian was of joy, for having ſo well accompliſht his deſign. As the Love of a Father to his Son is incomparably greater than common Amities, ſo the hate of the one to the other, when it grows vigorous is undoubtedly more extream than can be expreſt. In like manner the King, who was ſo affectionated to the Knight of the burning ſword, that he had almoſt equall'd him with <hi>Fulurtin,</hi> having heard the diſcourſe of this Whiſperer, grew ſo diſturb'd, that he had much ado ſo to govern his Paſſion, as to forbear ſending him at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment to receive his laſt Puniſhment, which yet, tho' not without putting a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now ſuch is commonly the Nature of Sin, that 'tis no ſooner brought into the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yet did remorſe of Conſcience, conducted by Reaſon, gain ſo much upon him, that he purpos'd at leaſt to ſave his life, by giving him notice t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ake of doing him a diſpleaſure, and adviſing him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to abſent himſelf from his Fury. This thought he put in Execution; A thing probably proceeding from GOD, not for the ſake of ſo wretehed a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as <hi>Maudan,</hi> but for the preſervation of the Innocent, for which cauſe we

               <p>The Sun was already retir'd behind the Mountains, and the Night approacht, when the Traytor found out the <hi>Knight of the Burn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

'Tis therefore neceſſary, you retire with all poſſible ſpeed; for I certainly know, that the King is reſolv'd to put you to death, for which purpoſe you will be Arreſted at your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Palace. The particular cauſe indeed I cannot learn, but ſome ſtory has been told him, for which he hates you to extremity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Knight of the burning ſword, as you will eaſily believe, was not a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſht at this Advertiſement, the truth of which, as not having any way offended, he would ſoon have queſtion'd, had not <hi>Maudan</hi> always pretended a particular kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for him. He gave therefore ſo much credit to this Traytor's words, that he immediately commanded <hi>Yneril</hi> his Eſquire to bring his Arms, and taking Horſe, went ſecretly forth of the Town, without any other Attendance, Riding all Night in marvellous diſcontent.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Maudan</hi> wove the Web, which afterward coſt him his life, as ſhall be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to you. In the mean time the better ſtill to cover his deſign, he went very late in the Evening to the King, to whom he ſaid: <hi>Sir, I doubt</hi> Yneril <hi>may have over heard ſome part of the diſcourſe, I had with Your Majeſty, about his Maſter; for I am certainly inform'd he was liſtning under the window: Which may be the more eaſily credited, for that I have not ſince ſeen the Knight of the burning ſword, whom I believe you will find to be fled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That would be ill,</hi> reply'd the King, <hi>therefore, pray, know the certainty of it, and that without delay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At theſe words <hi>Maudan</hi> went ſtrait out of the Palace, to the Knight's Lodgings, returning ſoon after, as in amaze, to tell the King, he was gone. <hi>Magadan,</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſent haſtily to apprehend the Queen <hi>Buruca,</hi> ſwearing, he would have her burnt alive; at which the poor Lady, who knew not for what occaſion, was very much troubled, and caſting her ſelf at the Kings feet, beſought him with hands held up to tell her the cauſe of his diſpleaſure. <hi>Wicked woman,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>you ſhall know too ſoon to your coſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then commanding her to be lock'd up, he ſet Guards upon her, charging them on peril of their lives to keep her ſafe. After this he ſent forth men on all ſides to look for the Knight of the burning ſword, and bring him either alive or dead, <hi>For,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>he has acted againſt me the greateſt Treaſon in the world.</hi>

               <p>Not long after thoſe, who had been in queſt of the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> return'd without hearing any news of him; at which the King was ſo enrag'd, that he wanted l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>SO long travell'd the</hi> Knight of the Burning Sword, <hi>with his Eſquire</hi> Yneril, <hi>that having Travers'd many Leagues without knowing whether, or which way they went, they came at laſt into a great Forreſt, in which they Rode two whole days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could find any way out.

                     </gap>ng deſir'd him to ſit down, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf a little, askt him whence he was, and what Adventure had brought him to that unhabitable Deſert:</hi> For, Son, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I believe, 'tis now above ten Years, ſince any reaſonable Creature, beſides you and I, has paſſed by the Place, where I now ſee you.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Moor, <hi>ſeeing his Youth, and hearing him ſpeak ſo appoſitly, and with ſo much reaſon, was wholly amaz'd, and exceedingly pity'd his condition: for as he utter'd theſe Words, the Tears in very great abundance trickled down his Cheeks. Wherefore he ſaid to him:</hi> Son, the Gods, to try thoſe, whom they love, and who are deareſt to them, often permit many Adverſities to come upon them, for ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Sins, they commit, as men, giving them afterward (inſtead of this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory life) Permanent and ever Bleſſed Glory. It is therefore neceſſary, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your will to their good pleaſure, rendring them glory and thanks for all they ſend you, were it only for the Beauty and good Wit, with which they have endu'd you: which makes me think, that many great things muſt paſs in you, as they have done in ſeveral, who ſhall ſerve you for an Example, as that King of great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> nam'd <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaul,</hi> and his Son <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> on whom the Divine Bounty heretofore beſtow'd ſuch Perfections as yours, altho' they ever were, and ſtill are Infidels, maintaining the Law of their CHRIST. But as the Sun affords his Light as well to the Wicked, as the Good: ſo our Gods indifferently extend their Graces and Mercies upon all Perſons, hoping by that means to bring them to the true knowledge of their Salvation. And tho' it be true, that <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> ſeeking ſtrange Adventures, as all Knights errant are wont to do, very often fell into ſuch Dangers, that they many times deſpair'd of their own lives and ſafety, and other whiles of ever having Joy, or Pleaſure, as you do now; yet after an infinity of Miſeries and Perils, which they eſcap'd, Fortune, or to ſay bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the divine Pleaſure has rais'd them to that height, that the one is become a great King, and the other a Potent Emperor, neither the one, nor the other having by their Birth any Right, or Pretence to the Countreys, they enjoy, but having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd them by the Magnanimity of their Courages, accompany'd with <hi>Prudence, Fortitude,</hi> and <hi>Virtue.</hi> Wherefore, my Son, endeavour to imitate them: for you have Ability and Diſcretion enough to reſemble them: and our Gods are as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as ever, to convert this your great Sorrow into Joy, ſurpaſſing your extream Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and the Evil, that afflicts you, into far greater Contentment, and Good.</p>

               <p>The Knight incontinently obey'd this Counſel, wondering nevertheleſs to hear the Good Man's diſcourſe, of whom he demanded, how he could tell it, would be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for him to be known.</p>

               <p>Then having apply'd ſuch Remedies to the Places, where he was wounded, that the Knight found himſelf without pain, the Old Man gave him ſome Victuals, he had in a Pannier, of which the Knight having eaten, fell into ſo ſound a Sleep, that it was brode day, when he awoke, finding himſelf Arm'd, not with the black Arms, which <hi>Yneril</hi> had brought him in exchange for his own, but with other white ones, much richer and ſtronger, with a Shield, ſuitable to them, in the midſt of which was painted a Sword, reſembling that, he Naturally had on his Body.</p>
               <p>The Knight, then exceedingly wondering, how this had befaln him was ſo perplext that he much doubted, whether he were not in a Dream, eſpecially when he no longer ſaw the Old Man, that had cur'd him.

Believe me, that Wiſe men advance only with the Time, and follow their good Fortune, when it preſents it ſelf, and to theſe two, Time and Fortune are all Perſons naturally ſubject. Put caſe therefore, that my Parents were</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>or ſtill are ſo, it is nevertheleſs for me to chooſe that Religion, which ſhall ſeem beſt to me, and not to imitate them, knowing that they Err. For this cauſe have the Gods made men differ from Beaſts, giving them Reaſon to chooſe the Good and Avoid the Evil. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I</hi> am reſolv'd (till ſuch time <hi>I</hi> am otherwiſe inſpir'd) to endeavour by all means the Augmentation of the</hi> Pagan <hi>Religion, and the Deſtruction of its contrary, were <hi>I</hi> therefore to dye a Thouſand Deaths for ſuch Death ought properly to be nam'd the beginning of Life. And moreover it is probable, that our Gods have caſt us upon theſe Coaſts, and deliver'd us out of danger, expreſly to force us to do them ſome agreeable ſervice here, in deſtroying this Rabble, which has ſo long reſided in this place. And as to what you have laid before me, ſaying, that <hi>I</hi> am bound to follow my Parents; to this I anſwer, that <hi>I</hi> am yet more oblig'd to them, to whom <hi>I</hi> ow my Education, as <hi>I</hi> will preſently prove by an Example, which was on a time amongſt other things told me by</hi> Mandaiar, <hi>who was my Inſtructer, whilſt <hi>I</hi> liv'd with</hi> Magadan. <hi>There was, and ſtill is at</hi> Sobradiſe <hi>a King, nam'd</hi> Don Galaor, <hi>who, being a Knight errant, was entertain'd in the Houſe of a Prince, which then Reign'd in great</hi> Britain, <hi>call'd</hi> Liſvart. <hi>Now it happen'd that a certain Difference aroſe between this</hi> Liſvart, <hi>and</hi> Amadis, <hi>Brother of</hi> Galaor, <hi>touching the Iſle of</hi> Mongaza, <hi>for defence of which</hi> Amadis, <hi>with his Father the King of</hi> Gaul, <hi>another Brother of his, nam'd</hi> Don Floreſtan, <hi>and many of their Kindred, Friends, and Allies, went into it: and to ſuch an height grew this Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, that there follow'd many fierce and cruel Battels, in which</hi> Galaor <hi>was always found on the ſide of the King, by whom he had been entertain'd, giving by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſs a certain Teſtimony of his acknowledgment for the great Benefits and Favors, he had receiv'd of him, preferring the Amity and ſervice, he bare him, before all Right of Affinity, and Parentage, tho' it were againſt his own Father. And by this
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:154293:17"/> thou may'ſt judge, that every Perſonage of noble Spirit is more indebted to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reaſon (by which he ought to govern himſelf) than to Father, Friends, Kinsfolks, or even his own ſelf.</hi>

Then he marcht bravely on, till he came near the firſt Tower, at the Window of which he perceiv'd two Knights, playing at Cheſs, the one bigger than the other, each of them about Fifty Years of Age, and both clad in Black. The leſſer had his Hair exceeding long, and his Beard below his Girdle, twiſted with Threads of Gold, which made the Knight certainly believe him to be, as indeed he was, the King of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But when the greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcryd the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> compleatly Arm'd, ready for Fight, and climbing up the Steps, cut in the Rock, he put his Head out of the Window, and ſpeaking to him in Greek, ſaid loud enough: <hi>Knight, paſs no farther, before we know what you are, otherwiſe the Cuſtom of this place requires, that you be made go down, whether you will or no.</hi>

Let us then finiſh it, and if Fortune permits me to out-live it thou mayeſt then do with more Reaſon, what Knighthood permits thee for Satisfaction of thy mind: otherwiſe the vengeance, thou ſhouldſt attempt to execute upon me, might turn to the diſadventage of thy Honour, ſo that thinking to kill me, thou mightſt perhaps put an end at the ſame time to thy virtue, and thy own Life, ſince the Hazard may aſſoon fall upon thee, as on me.</hi>

Nevertheleſs who ever thou art, it will be a Pleaſure to me to know thy Name, and much more, if thou wilt leave thy fooliſh Belief, and follow the Faith of</hi> IESVS CHRIST. <hi>This doing, I will not only quit thee the Combat betwixt us but will alſo find means, that the Emperor my Maſter ſhall receive thee in his houſe according to thy Merits.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Frandalo,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword, I was upon the point of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading thee to the ſame thing; It is then time loſt to think of giving Counſel to him, who comes n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nevertheleſs it hapned not ſo, the Knight bearing it off with his Shield, into which the Sword entred above an hands breadth, and the yet point fell ſo heavily upon his Helmet, that it was batter'd to his very head. And as the Gyant thought to draw out his Sword, he found himſelf ſo weak, that he had much ado to keep himſelf from falling with his noſe to the ground, the other ſtepping aſide with ſo much dexterity, that, as he drew back his Shield, he carried away his Adverſarys Sword, that ſtuck in it: and he was now lifting up his, to give the Gyant his deaths wound, when <hi>Frandalo,</hi> putting himſelf between them, ſaid thus: <hi>Ah!

               </p>
               <p>And as he finiſht this word, the Gyant, wholly enfeebled, fell flat upon the ground, ſo that they thought him to be dead, at which the Knight being ſomewhat ſorry, ſaid to <hi>Frandalo: In faith I wiſh you had not been ſo ſlow in asking me this Pleaſure, which I would willingly have accorded you, and, if it be not too late, do yet grant you.

At which the King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> being amaz'd, continually pray'd for the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> hoping by his Victory to regain his Liberty. Nevertheleſs, conſidering the ſhocks, he had already ſuſtain'd, and what he muſt ſuffer more, he very much doubted of that, which he would moſt ſecure himſelf of, ſeeing him, in his Opinion, as brisk, as if he had not handled his Sword that day. By means of which <hi>Frandalo</hi> began to diſtruſt himſelf, and being ſeiz'd with a chill and unuſual fear, perceiv'd his ſtrength to diminiſh, and that of his Adverſary to encreaſe and redouble.

And tho' the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> might eaſily without much more Labour have put an end to his defence; yet he drew a ſtep or two back, and leaning on the Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel of his Sword, as if he would take breath, began to ſay: <hi>Frandalo, thou canſt not but certainly know, that thy death is near, if thou contendeſt any longer againſt me: yield then, I pray thee good Sir, and I will ſave thy Life, ſo good an Opinion have I of thy Perſon.</hi>

               <p>Scarce had he finiſht this diſcourſe in his mind, when <hi>Frandalo,</hi> fainting, fell down to the Ground, without ſtirring either foot or hand. At which the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> being much griev'd, ran haſtily to untie his Helmet, to give him breath. Nevertheleſs the King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> thought, he would cut off his head, wherefore he cry'd out with a mournful Voice: <hi>Ah!

               </p>
               <p>At this cry the other left <hi>Frandalo,</hi> and taking off his Helmet, addreſt himſelf to the King, kneeling down before him to kiſs his hands, but the King embrac'd him, ſaying: <hi>Indeed I do not know, that ever I have ſeen you before: Therefore pray do me the favour to tell me, what knowledge you have of me, and who you are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>be pleas'd to command ſome one from within to bind up the Wounds of theſe Knights, before they dye: for it would diſcontent me, ſeeing their Proweſs, that any of them ſhould periſh for want of help. This done, I will anſwer you, the beſt I can, to what you pleaſe to know of me.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Indeed,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>there is not any one here, that underſtands, how to dreſs the Wounded; but below at the Monaſtery there is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he call d a Servant, whom he ſent to fetch one of the Religious, that was skill'd in Chirurgery. In the mean time he gave Order for diſarming <hi>Frandalo,</hi> and the Gyant <hi>Frandalon,</hi> who were carry'd, and laid in the beſt Chamber of the Caſtle. And the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Burning Sword,</hi> deſiring to know, who the firſt was that aſſaulted him at the Entrance of the Caſtle, they told him, he was nam'd <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leris,</hi> a courteous Perſonage, and Nephew to the Admiral <hi>Frandalo.</hi>

               <p>Then ſome ran thither, and finding him come to himſelf out of his Swound, took him up gently, and laid him in another Bed near <hi>Frandalo.</hi> Then the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> retir'd into another Chamber, and put himſelf between the Sheets, that the Monk might apply ſome Remedies to the Wounds, he had Receiv'd.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Diſcourſe the King of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> had with the <hi>Knight of the Burning-Sword</hi> concerning his Liberty, and afterward with <hi>Frandalo</hi> and <hi>Belleris.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>THe next day, after theſe things had thus faln out, the King of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>went to viſit the</hi> Knight of the Burning Sword, <hi>whom he found walking about his Chamber, for none of his Wounds were ſuch, as to oblige him to keep his Bed. And therefore ſeeing the King enter, he went to receive him, and with great Reverence beſought him to ſit down in a Velvet Chair, and placing himſelf near him, began his diſcourſe in this manner:</hi> Alas! Sir, how ſhall I ever be able to acknowledge the Honour, your Majeſty is pleas'd to do me, who am but a ſimple Knight, and as yet unknown? And nevertheleſs, you take the pains to come and viſit me, who have never done you any ſervice.</p>
               <p>My Friend, <hi>anſwer'd the King,</hi> he, that can deliver Kings out of Priſon, deſerves well to be honour'd by the greateſt Lords in the World, and for ever to be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by them. Is it not then reaſonable, that I, whoſe Liberty you have ſo valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtain'd, ſhould offer my ſelf to you, and continue all my life your Oblig'd.</p>
               <p>Pardon me Sir, <hi>reply'd the Knight,</hi> 'tis a ſmall matter to pay an Obligation, due by neceſſity. Now there is nothing more certain, than that ſuch, as Your Majeſty, are born into this World, to be Reverenc'd, and ſerv'd by all, all being naturally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd ſo to do, but that Obligation brings along with it this Benefit, that, whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfies it, is thereby honour'd, for as much as the Honour, he pays his Superior, or any other, is of ſuch a Nature, that it returns to the place, whence it proceeded, as the Rivers and Streams do into the Sea, out of which they came. So that, Sir, you do me wrong to thank me ſo much, ſince it is abundantly ſufficient to commend him, who does well, without giving him thanks. For, if he did otherwiſe than well, he would not (in reaſon) deſerve to be call'd a Man, but a brute and ſenſeleſs Beaſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King, hearing this goung Victorious Knight ſpeak ſo wiſely, and with ſo good a Grace, made him only this Anſwer:</hi> My great Friend, I ſee in you ſo much good Wit, that 'twould be a Folly for me, to think of vanquiſhing you either in word or effect: ſetting aſide therefore this Conteſt, I deſire you only to give me your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, how we ſhall henceforward govern our ſelves here, where there is not one in whom you truſt, but your Eſquire and my ſelf. And I much fear, that ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is fled to King <hi>Norandel</hi> with News of the Conqueſt, you have gain'd over <hi>Frandalo.</hi> Now he is ſo near us, that he will in leſs than a moment have Beſieg'd us, and Fortune may ſhew us her Countenance quite contrary to what it has been in this beginning.</p>
               <p>Since you will know what I think, <hi>reply'd the</hi> Knight of the Burning Sword, I will preſently tell you, I have left at the foot of this Caſtle a Bark, in which we

                  <hi>This Advice was well approv'd of, ſo that the Eſquire and another embarkt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after Dinner, when the King and the</hi> Knight of the Burning Sword <hi>went to viſit</hi> Frandalo, <hi>whom the King of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>askt, how he did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Majeſty, Sir, <hi>anſwer'd he,</hi> may ſee, and much better conſider, ſeeing the inconſtancy of Fortune, who towards the end of my declining years has ſhewn her ſelf ſo adverſe to me, that ſhe has brought me into Captivity, and under the Power of him, that could vanquiſh me, and by that means conquer this Place, with the keeping of which the Emperor my Maſter had intruſted me: which misfortune is much more afflicting to me, than death it ſelf. Nor can my life be henceforth other than a trouble to me, ſince I deſir'd its continuance only to ſerve him, who had put me in the Honour and State, in which I yeſterday day was.</p>
               <p>Ah <hi>Frandalo! ſaid the King,</hi> You have ever been eſteem'd one of the wiſeſt Knights in the World, and now methinks, you would ſeem guilty of that, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any place in you, <hi>viz.</hi> Puſillanimity. Pray good Sir, make uſe of the Counſel, you have ſo often given me, thinking to comfort me, whilſt I was a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to ſhew the Magnanimity of your heart, taking example by many others, who have paſs'd thro' ſuch ſtreights, as you are at preſent in, and out of which you may get with Honour, knowing the Virtue, that is in this Knight, whom I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for you: for he alone can do it, and no other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Knight of the Burning Sword, <hi>hearing the King ſpeak ſo much to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, could not forbear bluſhing, wherefore taking up the diſcourſe, he ſaid to him:</hi> Sir, your Majeſty may command me in all things. And as for you <hi>Frandalo,</hi> your Goodneſs and Loyalty ſufficiently ſatisfie, what you ere while Remonſtrated to the King, and the Efforts, you made me feel yeſterday in defence, of what the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had committed to your keeping, will always teſtifie the Endeavour, you us'd to ſerve him faithfully. You have not then any Reaſon to complain of Fortune; but ought rather to eſteem her favourable to you, than adverſe or cruel: ſince ſhe has not any way abas'd your Honour, but exalted your Renown by your Loſs, which ought Rather to be eſteem'd a Gain, than otherwiſe: ſeeing I bear you more Envy for the Honour, you have gain'd with me, than I ſhould Glory, had I reduc'd this Iſland under the Law of our Gods, as it heretofore was.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight, <hi>anſwer'd</hi> Frandalo, the little knowledge, I yet have of you, will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me perhaps from thanking you for the Praiſes, you give me, ſo highly, as you deſerve, ſo eaſily may it be ſeen, that you deſire in all things to render your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and Proweſs, equal to your Diſcretion, and Vertue, not to loſe by Reaſons, and diſcourſe the Conqueſt, the Goodneſs of your Chivalry has made in me. I will not heretofore any longer contend with you in words, fearing leaſt by them you may gain over me, what with the hazard of your Life you could never have obtain'd, which is to make me voluntarily yours.</p>

               <p>This ſaid, he held his Peace, his weakneſs not ſuffering him to ſpeak any more.

               <argument>
                  <p>How <hi>Garinda,</hi> ſent by <hi>Onoloria,</hi> to fetch from <hi>Filina</hi> the little <hi>Amadis of Greece,</hi> that was loſt, fled thro' deſpair into a Wood, not daring to return to her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs: and of that, which happen'd.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>YOu will find it Recorded in the moſt Excellent Hiſtory of <hi>Amadis of Gaul,</hi> about the latter end of the Sixth Book, how <hi>Onoloria</hi> and <hi>Gricileria</hi> were each of them deliver'd of a fair Son, whom they ſent to the Port of <hi>Filina,</hi> to be there Nurſt; but Fortune would, that the little <hi>Amadis of Greece</hi> was met by the <hi>Moors,</hi> who carry'd him into their Gallies, where he was bred up by them, and was afterwards nam'd the <hi>Gentleman of the Burning Sword,</hi> as you have been told. Now you are to underſtand, that theſe two Princeſſes, thinking <hi>Garinda</hi> had entirely ſatisfy'd their command, and that the two Children were plac'd with careful Nurſes, often ſent their faithful Meſſenger, to enquire how they did, who always told them the quite contrary to what was befaln the little <hi>Amadis.</hi> As for the other, ſhe deliver'd him to a Coſen of hers, nam'd <hi>Floriſma,</hi> who ſoon after became a Widow, having but one only Son, call'd <hi>Florindo,</hi> whom ſhe Educated with the little <hi>Lucencio.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Year after which the Empreſs of <hi>Trebiſond</hi> came to the Monaſtery of <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> ſo diſcontented, becauſe ſhe could have no News of the Emperor, that ſhe reſolv'd to continue with her Daughters, and no longer concern her ſelf with the Government of the Empire. She was receiv'd by them in a manner, ſuitable to her ſtate, and they endeavour'd by all means poſſible to mitigate her ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Now one day amongſt the reſt it happen'd, that <hi>Onoloria,</hi> deſirous to ſee her Son, commanded <hi>Garinda</hi> to go and fetch him from <hi>Filina,</hi> and, that ſhe might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all Suſpicion, charg'd her expreſly to ſay, that he was her Nephew, or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Son. <hi>Garinda,</hi> ſeeing what ſhe had ſo long conceal'd, now upon the point to be diſcover'd, went her way ſo exceeding melancholly, that ſhe wiſht her ſelf dead. In this deſpair ſhe betook her ſelf to the Thickeſt part of the Forreſt, fully purpoſing never any more to be ſeen by either Man or Woman, but to finiſh her days with as much miſery as ſhe found her ſelf unhappy. In this Determination ſhe ſpy'd a Cave, which ſhe choſe for her abode, eating from that time, no other Food, but wild and ill taſted Herbs; hoping by this Auſterity to ſhorten her Years, and ſoon bring her life to an end.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Onoloria</hi> expected her from hour to hour, but not ſeeing her return, was
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:154293:21"/> very much amaz'd, ſending a Country man to <hi>Filina,</hi> to know, what was become of her, and whence her ſtay proceeded. The Fellow with great diligence enquir'd, as he had been commanded, all about, but could not hear any Tale or Tydings of her: wherefore he return'd to the Monaſtery, where being arriv'd, and having made his Report, I leave you to think, in what trouble the ſorrowful Mother was, who will recover the Ioy, ſhe has loſt, when it ſhall pleaſe GOD.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the little <hi>Lucencio</hi> grew up from day to day, thinking himſelf to be Son to the good Widow <hi>Floriſma,</hi> and Brother to <hi>Florindo,</hi> whom he lov'd as his ſecond ſelf. They were both now come to ſuch an Age, that they were ſtrong enough to go an Hunting. Now as they ſat ſometimes, during the He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t of the day, under the ſhadow of the Trees, expecting the Cool of the Evening, when they might better find their Prey, <hi>Lucencio</hi> would in this manner diſcourſe his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: <hi>Brother, there is nothing in this world, I ſhould more deſire, than if it were poſſible, to be of the Order of Knighthood. But what? I ſee not any likehood of ever being ſo: for our Father was not a Gentleman, but a Labourer, tho' a rich and honeſt man, nor are we noble, but Ruſticks, and People of this Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are reputed unworthy to follow Arms: at which I am ready to dye for ſpight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So frequent was this diſcourſe with <hi>Lucenio,</hi> that the good Widow being Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertis'd thereof by <hi>Florindo,</hi> which made her from that time doubt, leſt coming to underſtand the truth of his condition, he ſhould leave her: therefore to obviate this, ſhe us'd her utmoſt endeavours to conceal it from him.</p>
               <p>But it happen'd one time, as he and his Companion were an Hunting, having each of them a Bow in his hand, they met an Hind, at which they ſhot, and wounded her, yet not ſo, but that ſhe fled through the Thickets, whether the Dogs follow'd her, ſhe doubling ſo with them, that they came to a Fault, and a little after began again their cry, ſo that <hi>Lucencio</hi> and <hi>Florindo,</hi> thinking they had run her down, made haſt in to 'em. They perceiv'd them environing a naked Woman, who was ſo disfigur'd, that ſhe ſeem'd rather a Phantaſm, than an humane Creature, at the ſight of which <hi>Florindo</hi> was ſo frighted, that he turn'd his Face, flying, and trembling like the Leaf.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Lucenio,</hi> whoſe blood could not deny the place, from whence he was deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, advanc'd, and taking his Staff, drave away the Dogs from about this woman, to whom he ſaid: <hi>By my Fathers ſoul, I will now ſee whether you are an Hobgoblin, or ſome Devil diſguis'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The poor Creature, wholly aſtoniſht, as thinking he would beat her, caſt her ſelf on her knees, and joyning her hands, anſwer'd him: <hi>Ah Gentleman, I beſeech you by the Faith you owe to GOD, to leave me in peace, without adding farther Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Miſery, in which I have now liv'd theſe thirteen or fourteen years, and ſhall live, as long as it ſhall pleaſe him, who has given me Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucencio,</hi> not without cauſe wondering to hear her ſpeak ſo diſcreetly, whom he juſt now took for a Phantaſm, took a more diſtinct view of her, than he had hitherto done, and judg'd by the Lineaments of her Face, that ſhe muſt have been heretofore
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:154293:22"/> handſome: wherefore he askt her, how ſhe came to make her Repair to this Place, inhabited only by wild and ſavage Beaſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alas!</hi> anſwer'd ſhe, <hi>I pray you deſire not to know it: for my Misfortune is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than you can comprehend: Wherefore I deſire you to take away your Dogs, and not importune me any farther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucencio</hi> had ſuch pity of her, that he graciouſly made her this Reply: <hi>Dame I will readily obey you, altho' you would have more reaſon, and greater joy, if leaving this Auſtere Life, you would come with me to my Mother, whither I will willingly conduct you for the Deſire, I have to ſerve you, and all others, that would employ me.</hi>

               <p>Scarce had he utter'd this Word, but ſhe began tenderly to weep and ſigh. And <hi>Lucencio,</hi> thinking, that theſe her Tears proceeded from her hearing of <hi>Sinofry</hi>'s Death, askt her, if ſhe ever knew him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Indeed, my Child,</hi> anſwer'd ſhe, <hi>I have many times ſeen your Father, and know perhaps more of your Affairs, than you do your ſelf: ſince I can aſſure you, that</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nofry <hi>nothing concern'd you.</hi>

                  <hi>Indeed Dame,</hi> reply'd he, <hi>I promiſe it you whatever you pleaſe to ask me.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>My Child,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>aſſure your ſelf, that your Father and Mother are of ſuch noble Blood, that you are deſcended of an Emperor, and a King.

Then returning the way he came, he heard a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Florindo</hi> calling him with a loud and mournful Voice: for he thought him to be dead, and for this reaſon bitterly wept, and diſcomforted himſelf; but <hi>Lucencio</hi> took his Horn, which he winded ſo loud, that his Companion heard him, and being wholly reaſſur'd, came to meet him, ſaying to him at his Arrival with Tears ſtill in his eyes: <hi>Alas Brother, I was greatly afraid of the Wild Beaſt, believing, ſhe had outrag'd you. On my faith I lookt upon you as gone, nor can I tell what made you ſo haſty to caſt your ſelf into her Paws.</hi>

                  <hi>Lucencio</hi> ſmillingly anſwer'd him: <hi>Have I not often enough told you, that the Sons of ſuch, as you and I are, cannot be Knights? for they have naturally fear for a Companion inſtead of Aſſurance, as you have experimented in your ſelf.

               <p>The Emperor was (at the time of their Arrival) in the great Hall of his Palace, attended by many Valiant Knights, all clad in mourning for the Death of the Old Emperor, and his Wife, deceas'd not long before.

               <p>The Emperor, ſeeing him ſo fair, young, and wel-demean'd, lookt on him with ſuch an Eye, that he was mov'd to pity, and anſwer'd him: <hi>Truly, my Friend, I will do, what you deſire me: for I believe, as far as I can gueſs by your Perſon, that Knighthood will not be ill imploy'd in you.</hi>

               <p>Then ſhe, who appear'd to be the Lady of this Company, humbly ſaluted the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and making him a Reverence, endeavour'd to kiſs his hands, as the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man alſo did: but he graciouſly lifted them up, asking them, if they had any Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with him.</p>

                  <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwer'd ſhe, <hi>Your Majeſty will be pleas'd to underſtand, that I am Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of</hi> Savoy, <hi>nam'd</hi> Grimarta, <hi>and as to this Gentleman, neither You, nor any other, can know his Name, before that be accompliſh'd, for which we are come forth of our Country, and with which I am now going to acquaint you. Your Majeſty then may underſtand, that, the Duke, my Father, dying without any Heirs, but my ſelf, I was incontinently crown'd in the City of</hi> Chambery,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:154293:24"/> 
                  <hi>where this Gentleman was then newly arriv'd, who, vanquiſht with Love of me, had leſt his own Countrey, hoping, after he ſhould have ſeen me, ſo to employ himſelf in ſerving me, that his Travel and Good Will ſhould be in ſuch manner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd by me, as he might attain to the end of his Deſires. And indeed, if my Fame had caus'd in him any Affection for me, 'twas little in reſpect of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, he found in himſelf, as ſoon as his Eye had given him the enjoyment of my Preſence: Which Zeal was yet much more augmented, after he had begun famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly to diſcourſe with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It hapned then, that one day amongſt the reſt, the Fire of this Love encreaſing by little and little, as we were a hunting with a good Company of Gentlemen, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and Damſels, diſpers'd about the Woods, ſome this way, others that way, I was at a certain Stand, accompany'd only by four of my Women, and two Knights, with this Gentleman. Now ſo it was, that a chafed Bear came running ſo furiouſly towards us with open Mouth, that the two Knights, in whom lay the Safety of our Perſons, were ſo ſrighted, that they fled with all their might thro' the Foreſt. Your Majeſty will eaſily believe the Fright. I was then in: But this Gentleman, alighting from his horſe, ſhew'd himſelf ſo valiant, that at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Bear, who thought to lay hold of him, he gave him ſuch a blow with his Staff between his two ears, that he fell dead to the ground. This gave me ſuch Content, that I determin'd in my ſelf from that very hour to love him, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, and not without cauſe, conſidering his Civility, the Pains, he had taken, in coming from a far Countrey, to ſee, and ſerve me, and the Danger, to which he expos'd himſelf, for to ſave My Life, ſhewing himſelf, tho' naked, and unarm'd, more couragious than thoſe two, who turn'd their backs with their Lances, and Shields.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore I began from that time forward to treat him with more intimacy, than I had done, offering him my Eſtate, and what ever a Woman of my quality can honeſtly offer: Which gave him ſo much content, that, after a thouſand thanks, he ſaid to me: <hi>Madam, tho' it will be impoſſible for me, as long as I live, to acknowledge the Favour, and Honour, you have been pleas'd, and are pleas'd to do me, I being ſuch, as I am, and you ſo great a Lady, and Princeſs; yet will I, with Proteſtation not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you, take the boldneſs to make you a farther Requeſt, which I moſt humbly deſire you to grant me, hoping, that the Effect will redound to your Glory, and my Honour. 'Tis that you will be pleas'd to give me leave to go into</hi> Great Britain <hi>to King</hi> Amadis, <hi>that I may of him at your requeſt receive the Order of Knighthood. This done, forasmuch as that Countrey is ſaid to be frequented with adventurous Knights, than any other, I will for Love of you, and under the Favor of your Preſence, keep, and defend a Paſſage, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Space of ſix Months, againſt all thoſe, that ſhall attempt to paſs it, on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that, if I be vanquiſht within the ſaid time, the Conqueror ſhall receive of you a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el of ſuch value, as you ſhall think fit to give him; but if Fortune give me the Honour to get the better, he, or they, that ſhall yield, ſhall be conſtrain'd to leave their Shields in your Pavilion, with their Names in writing, for an aſſurance, that they will come, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:154293:24"/> ſerve you, when you ſhall require them. And if it happen, that in this Enterpriſe I do any thing, worthy your Love, it will pleaſe you then to grant it me, and not ſooner: for GOD for bid, that a Princeſs of your high quality ſhould have any Friend, but ſuch, as ſhe merits; nor would it be Reaſon, that I, or any other, having done ſo little for you, ſhould attain ſo great Happineſs, as by your Authority to call himſelf Yours.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Requeſt, Sir, I ſo willingly granted him, that a few days after we ſet forth on our journey, and for the Jewel, he ſpeak to me of, I caus'd to be brought with me this Sword, and Shield, which you ſee, with an Helmet, which for its Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Beauty, and Richneſs, is not to be valu'd. But by misfortune</hi> (ſaid ſhe, ſhewing one of her Women) <hi>this Gentlewoman, in whoſe cuſtody it was, ſtaying behind us this morning; was met by a Knight, who askt her, for whom ſhe kept it. She anſwer'd him, for the beſt Knight in the world. Then he more diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, than Gentility deſires, took it from her by force, ſaying, that, ſince it was dedicated to the beſt Knight in the world, it belong'd to none but him. And hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gotten it from her againſt her will, he fled thro' the wood, ſo that ſhe loſt ſight of him: at which being greatly diſcontented, ſhe came to us, weeping for the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, which ſhe related to us. Theſe Knights, who accompany me, hearing it, ran to overtake him; but ſeeing they loſt their Labor in ſearching for him, being advertiz'd, that you made your Abode in this your City, we reſolv'd to come, and pay you our Reſpects, and know, whether you would pleaſe to command us any thing to King</hi> Amadis: <hi>with whom we had long ſince been, had not Fortune dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us into theſe Coaſts.</hi> This ſaid, ſhe held her peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> anſwer'd the Emperor, <hi>You have done me both an Honour, and a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by this friendly Viſit, for which I heartily thank you, and this Gentleman al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, to whom Our Lord, if he pleaſe, grant the Grace to accompliſh ſo noble an Enterpriſe: And as to the Villian, who has done you the Injury about your Helmet, believe me, I am very much diſpleas'd at it, as well that ſo baſe an Act ſhould be done in my Countreys, as that it ſhould be committed againſt a Lady of your Rank.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During this Diſcourſe, <hi>Lucencio</hi> thought in himſelf, that he would go to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the Damſel, and recover, what ſhe had loſt: Wherefore without any farther delay he kneel'd down, and beſought the Emperor, that he would give him leave ſo to do: which he readily granted him. Then addreſſing himſelf to the Dutcheſs, he ſaid to her: <hi>Madam, I have all my life heard, that Knighthood was principally ordain'd, to preſerve Ladies and Gentlewomen from Injury: I entreat you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore command her, whom the Knight has thus wrong'd, to conduct me, till ſuch time, as we have found him, and I promiſe you by the Faith, I ow the Emperor, to revenge her, and you alſo; or to dy in the attempt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truly Knight,</hi> anſwer'd the Dutcheſs, <hi>I very heartily thank you:</hi> and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately commanded the Damſel to accompany him, ſaying to her: <hi>And as ſoon as you ſhall have recover'd the Helmet, fail not to come into</hi> Great Britain.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Lucencio,</hi> having eaten ſomething, took horſe, and accompany'd only by <hi>Florindo,</hi> who ſerv'd him for an Eſquire, and the Damſel, departed out of the City,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:154293:25"/> in which the Dutcheſs made afterward but a very ſhort ſtay: for having thankt the Emperor for her good Reception; and taken her leave of Him, the Lords and Ladies, ſhe embarkt, ſteering towards <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Pillars, for to enter into the Ocean Sea. Now there were many upon the Shore, looking after her at her departure when a Knight, compleatly arm'd, except his Head and his Hands, entred the Palace, and ſaluting the Emperor, was known to be <hi>Sergil. Eſplandian</hi> heartily welcom'd him, asking him, how King <hi>Norandel</hi> did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>He humbly recommends himſelf to your good Grace, and has ſent me expreſly to acquaint you, that one ſole Knight has valiantly conquer'd the</hi> Defended Mountain, <hi>fought with, and vanquiſht</hi> Belleris, Frandalon, <hi>and</hi> Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalo, <hi>ſo that he, and the King of</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>are become Maſters of the Fortreſs, as we are certainly inform'd by two Souldiers of the Garriſon, who have made their Eſcape to</hi> Teſifanto. <hi>May it pleaſe you therefore, Sir, to adviſe, how you will have King</hi> Norandel <hi>govern himſelf in this Affair, and to conſider the importance of the Place, eaſy to be regain'd before the</hi> Turks <hi>ſend Succour thither, if you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How?</hi> reply'd the Emperor: <hi>Is it poſſible, that one only Knight has done ſo many Feats of Arms, as you ſay? And are my People all dead?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No, Sir,</hi> ſaid he: <hi>But never Knights better did their Devoir, tho' they were in fine vanquiſht, and left without means to defend themſeves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>GOD be prais'd for all,</hi> anſwer'd the Emperor: <hi>We muſt endeavour to provide for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he call'd the Prince of <hi>Brandalia,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>Saluder;</hi> to whom he gave Order for the Equipping, and Arming all the Veſſels, they could aſſemble, with Souldiers, and other Perſons neceſſary for the Voyage.

                  <hi>As GOD ſhall help me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lucencio, he is one of the handſom'ſt young men, I ever ſaw, and of whom I hope much.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus diſcourſing, they entred the Forreſt, on the edge of which, they met a poor man, loaden with wood, of whom the Dam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>He is before,</hi> anſwer d the Clown, <hi>and cann't be above two leagues off: turn on your Right hand at the next croſs way, and you may eaſily overtake him before night, if you make haſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucencio,</hi> very glad of this Account, ſpur'd after him; yet did he Travel two days, and two nights, before he had any farther News of him. The third day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, as he came forth of the Wood in a long and ſpacious Plain, he ſaw two Knights, fighting furiouſly one againſt the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ha!</hi> ſaid <hi>Lucencio</hi> then to the Damſel, <hi>Never truſt me, if there ben't your man; I pray you fair Lady, go no farther leſt he know you, for if it be he, 'tis to be fear'd, he will flye to ſave his Theft: keep your ſelf therefore conceal'd with my Eſquire, till I have ſpoken with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſaid this, he rode on a great Gallop, and being come near to thoſe that were ſighting, they ſtood ſtill, to know, what he lookt for. But <hi>Lucencio,</hi> eaſily knowing the Knight, he ſought for, by the Marks, that had been given him, cry'd out to him: <hi>Ill-bred Knight, who robbeſt travelling Damſels, reſtore the Helmet, or thou ſhalt dy an evil Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Helmet?</hi> anſwer'd the other, <hi>It belongs ſo juſtly to me, that you ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have it, ſeeing it is mine.</hi>

                  <hi>Truly Knight,</hi> reply'd he, that took it, <hi>I no longer wonder at your being ſo lean, ſince you trouble your ſelf about ſo many things.

                  </gap>th ſuch force, that, his Staff breaking in pieces, he tumbled him on the ground; yet he held faſt the Reins of his Steed, and ſoon after got up again. In the mean time <hi>Lucencio</hi> turn'd his Bridle, and ſetting his hand to his Sword there began ſo ſharp and dangerous a fight of two againſt one, that <hi>Lucencio</hi> preſently knew the Peril, he ſhould be in, if he did not look the better about him. Then altho' he had never been at ſuch ſport before, mov'd nevertheleſs with a natural Inſtinct to imitate thoſe of whom he was deſcended, he had ſo good and vertuous an Heart, that his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſoon perceiv'd it, the Field being in many places dy'd with their Blood. But our Gameſter was pretty well matcht: for the two Aſſailants treated him ſo ill, that he felt himſelf ſo wounded, as to doubt of his Death: at which he became ſo furious that he entred pell mell betwixt them, iuſt as a chafed Bull does amongſt thoſe, who provoke him in the Place, where he is to be baited. And thus ſtriking on the right hand, and on the left, he met, not with the Knight, that had robb'd the Damſel, but the other, whom he gave ſuch a Blow on the ear with the Pommel of his Sword, that it made him bow his Head as low as his Saddle-bow, and, before he could recover himſelf, <hi>Lucencio,</hi> redoubling his Stroke, with the edge of his Sword ſmote his Head from his Shoulders. his Body falling reaking to the ground. Of which <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencio</hi> glad, cry'd out loud enough: <hi>In good faith, Maſter, you will now have no more need of a Night-cap, much leſs of the Helmet, you ſo greatly deſir'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the other ſaw his Companion in ſo ill a Condition, he no longer deſir'd to try the Force of him, he had injur'd: the better therefore to ſecure himſelf, feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to revenge his Fellow, he drew near, and lifting up his Arm, gave <hi>Lucencio's</hi> Horſe ſuch a Blow with his Sword between the two Ears, that he kill'd him: then giving his own Horſe the Reins, he turn'd his Back, flying, as if a thouſand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils were at his heels. You may eaſily believe, that <hi>Lucencio</hi> was not a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd: for he ſaw himſelf without an Horſe, and out of hopes as it were to recover what he ſought, which was the Helmet, that the other carry'd away. But when he was got up, ſpying the dead Knights Steed paſs by, he found means to ſeiſe of him, and getting on his back, poſted after him, that was fled.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Florindo</hi> and the Damſel, who had kept themſelves conceal'd within the Forreſt, ſeeing him thus ſpeed away, came out of their ambuſh to follow him: but they loſt ſight of him, and it was almoſt Night, when they ſaw him again on the top of an Hill, whence he diſcover'd his Man, making ſuch haſt down, that his Horſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tir'd, and out of breath, he took ſo great a Leap along the Valley, that he roll'd above a Stones caſt, before he ſtopt, in ſuch manner that <hi>Lucencio</hi> could not forbear laughing: for he thought, the Horſe had broken his own Neck, and his Maſters too. Nevertheleſs they both got up again, and in the mean time <hi>Lucencio</hi> approacht, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a loud: <hi>By my Faith, Sir Knight, you ſhall now leave the Helmet, which is none of yours, and your Head likewiſe.</hi>

               <p>The other, ſeeing him ſo cloſe at his heels, thought no way better to ſecure his life, than to throw down, what he had, hoping that <hi>Lucencio,</hi> inſtead of purſuing him, would amuſe himſelf in taking it up.

Then he turn'd back to the Place, where he ſaw the Knight throw down the Helmet, but he found it not there: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought that <hi>Florindo</hi> and the Damſel had taken it up: And for this cauſe he lookt round about to ſee, whether he could eſpy them; but it was in vain. At which being much troubled, he return'd to the top of the Hill, and entring thence into the Forreſt, reſolv'd to ſtay there till morning: for the Darkneſs was by this time ſo great, that he could not ſee which way to go.</p>
               <p>By and by, he heard an horſe neigh, and thinking it might be thoſe he lookt for, he rode thither, where by the light of a great Fire he perceiv'd a very fair and young Lady, waſhing her hands in a Fountain, which ſprang forth of an hollow Rock cloſe by. Se was attended by ſix others, having each of them on their Heads Garlands and Chaplets of very odoriferous Flowers, two of which joyning their Voices to the Sound of the Lutes, which they ſweetly toucht, made the Air ſound with ſuch a Harmony, that <hi>Lucencio</hi> became wholly aſtoniſht, ſurpris d nevertheleſs with ſome Ardor of Love, which ſo enflam'd his heart, that he approacht them, and ſaluting the Company, addreſt himſelf to the faireſt of them, to whom he ſaid: <hi>Madam, I beſeech you to excuſe my Preſumption towa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At this Diſcourſe ſhe, who thought only of refreſhing her ſelf, lifted up her head, and ſeeing him all Arm'd, except his Helmet, which he carry'd at his Saddle-Bow, was at firſt amaz'd; but his Demeanor, appear'd ſo gentle, that ſhe reaſſur'd her ſelf, ing him what he ſought.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>I was looking for an Eſquire of mine, and a Damſel, whom he accompanys: but Love, I think, has directed me to the Light of this Fire, to make me experiment the heat of a ſeverer, with which I already feel my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd; yet your great Beauty and Excellence, which have kindled it in my heart, have alſo the means to moderate it, if you pleaſe to take pity of me, who never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended you, as I know of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lady, hearing him ſpeak with ſuch affection, could not forbear ſmiling, and feigning not to underſtand this Language of Love, turn'd the Cart againſt the horſe, ſaying to him: <hi>And how did your People loſe you thus?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Lucencio, as I was going after a Knight, who had forcibly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken an Helmet from the Damſel, I ſpeak of my Eſquire and ſhe, who follow'd me at a Diſtance, were ſurpriz'd by the night, and I expected to meet with them in this wood, but I find my ſelf much miſtaken: for thinking to recover another I have loſt my ſelf by the Extremity of that Divine Beauty, with which you are endued.</hi> Then he related to her from point to point all, that you have heard of the Helmet, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lucencio, the Charms of your Beauty have made me ſo much yours that you may command me in what-ever you pleaſe, and I ſhall be yet more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to ſerve you, if by your means I may recover the Helmet, which I am obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to reſtore to her that follows me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſhe lifted up the border of a Sattin Mantle on which ſhe ſat, and ſhew'd it him, ſaying: <hi>Is not this what you look for?

               <p>He, who deſir'd no better Occaſion of diſcourſing with her, readily obey'd her: and, when he was ſat, ſhe ſent one her Women out of the Forreſt, to ſee, whether ſhe could underſtand any thing of the Squire, and Damſel, that were gone aſtray: (for already the Moon began to ſhine) and in the mean time ſhe entred into diſcourſe with <hi>Lucencio,</hi> to whom ſhe ſaid: <hi>Knight, you have promis'd me a Gift, ſuch as I ſhall ask you. In order to the accompliſhment of this promiſe, I deſire you, that as ſoon, as you ſhall have recover'd your Eſquire, and the Damſel you have loſt, you will accompany me to a Ship of mine, which my People have at Anchor hard by, and out of which I landed this morning, as well to ſee this Country, which ſeem'd to me pleaſant, and well-ſhaded, as to refreſh me after my Travel on the Sea, where I have long voyag'd.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the Emperor <hi>Eſplandian</hi> arriv'd at the <hi>Defended Mountain,</hi> where he fought with the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword:</hi> and what was the Iſſue of their Combat.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> continu'd in the Caſtle of the <hi>Defended Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> above three weeks after the Victory, he had gotten over thoſe, that guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: during which, there paſs'd not a Day, but he went to viſit <hi>Frandalo,</hi> and the other wounded Knights, till ſuch time as <hi>Yneril</hi> return'd from <hi>Natolia</hi> with a Reinforcement of twenty <hi>Turks,</hi> who were very well receiv'd, eſpecially by the King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who had before related to the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> the manner, how he was taken at the Siege of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as his Son and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were a little before by <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaul,</hi> then Surnam'd the <hi>Knight of the Sphere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But believe me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>never was captive Prince more honour'd, or better treated, or had ſo many Civilities ſhewn him, as I receiv'd from King</hi> Amadis, <hi>and the Emperor</hi> Eſplandian.</p>
               <p>Then he related at large the Favours, and Courteſies, that had been done him, which were ſo many, that the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> ſaid aloud: <hi>Truly I muſt even from your Diſcourſe confeſs, that Vertue and Proweſs are more familiar to</hi> Amadis <hi>and his Children, than to any other Knights in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As they diſcours'd thus, leaning on a Window, that lookt towards the Sea, they perceiv'd a Bark with two Oars come into the Harbour, out of which landed a Knight, arm'd in black Armor, all but his Head, an Eſquire bearing his Helmet, and a Damſel his Shield, on the midſt of which in a Field <hi>Or</hi> was painted a Croſs, red as blood. They began to aſcend the Steps, cut in the Rock, ſo that in a little time they were come to the Portal, where the Knight made himſelf ready to fight. Which being ſeen by him <hi>of the Burning Sword,</hi> who beheld him come ſo boldly up, he knew not at firſt what to think of him; but it came at laſt into his mind, that he was indeed ſome <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who, having underſtood the Loſs of the Caſtle, would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to recover it, if he could. And for this Reaſon he askt him out of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, whither he was going, and what he ſought: <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the Blaſon of that Shield you bear, teſtifies that you can be no other than an Enemy to the</hi> Turks.</p>
               <p>At this word the black Knight lifted up his Eyes, and ſeeing him, that queſtion'd him, thought him the faireſt Perſonage, he had ever beheld: wherefore he anſwer'd him: <hi>In good faith Knight, if you are he that have gain'd this Caſtle by force of Arms, Knighthood indeed (conſidering your young Age, and what your Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhews) is better employ'd in you, than in any other, I know; and if your
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:154293:28"/> Conditions are ſuch as Fame reports them, you ought not to take it ill, that (bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Sign, which is in my Shield) I endeavour to do what you have done, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to prove my ſelf againſt you, as againſt the moſt courteous, and valiant Knight of</hi> Aſia. <hi>I deſire you then to cauſe the Gate to be open'd for me: For, on the Security of your word, I will come in, and we will try (if you will take my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) which of us two Fortune will moſt favour in fight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> eaſily imagin'd by the Diſcourſe of the other, that he muſt be ſome valiant Man. And for that reaſon he ſaid to him: <hi>Indeed, Knight, you ſpeak ſo much to my advantage, that I greatly doubt, whether I ought to aſſure you that I am he, you imagin, or another. One certainty there is, that Honour always redounds to him, from whom it parts: thus you cannot but gain Honour by the Combat, you demand, whether you have the better, or the worſe. For to praiſe the Strength, and Vertues of ones Enemy is nothing elſe, but to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate ones ſelf, and to deſire to conquer his Heart by Virtue, before one attempt his Body by Force. And therefore, ſince you are come to hazard your life, and to endeavour the gaining of Renown by doing what your Law obliges you to, it would neither be reaſonable, nor courteous in me to deny you, what you deſire of me.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay then a little, and I will cauſe you to be let in on the Condition, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and which I willingly grant you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he retir'd from the Window, leaving the black Knight extremely ſatisfy'd with the Civility of his Diſcourſe. But he ſtaid not long before the Gate was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, at the entrance of which a portly Knight preſented himſelf, arm'd with white Armor, and having about his Neck a Shield, on which was painted a Red Sword, with ſome Characters, that he could not underſtand: nevertheleſs he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much, that it was he, who had ſpoken to him at the Window, and with whom he deſir'd to fight: for he bad him enter, and then endeavour to accompliſh that for which he was come.</p>
               <p>At this word the black Knight paſs'd on, and, as he entred, ſaid to the other: <hi>I pray you good Sir, let our Combat be farther in the inner Court of the Caſtle.</hi> This he ſaid, fearing, leſt (if he ſhould vanquiſh) the Door might be ſhut againſt him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> very well knowing what he meant, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd him, that he was well pleas'd, it ſhould be ſo, and offering him the Honour of the way, importun'd him to go in firſt: but the black Knight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd it, telling him, that He, who was Lord of the Place, ought to ſhew him the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will obey you then,</hi> anſwer'd the other: <hi>for it may be thinking to ſhew my ſelf too courteous towards you, I may fail in not doing, what you deſire: I have alſo all my life heard ſay, that Knights, who are upon the point to combat, ought to have Courteſie in no leſs eſteem, than Honour uſing towards each other humble and gracious Diſcourſes, remitting all the Ill Will, they may bear one another, to the Strength of their Arms, guided by the Magnanimity of their hearts, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:154293:29"/> of the future Victory: which if they obtain, it is ſo much the more glorious, as their Diſcourſe was more courteous and affable, than the Place and Occaſion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he paſs'd on, and the black Knight after him, who, before they began the Combat, ſaid to him: <hi>Knight, if thou wouldſt leave thy fooliſh Belief, and follow me to a Place, where thy Strength and Courage would be better employ'd for his Glory and Honour, of whom thou haſt receiv'd them, believe me, I would eaſily forbear this Conteſt, not for any doubt, I have of thee; but only to the end we might be Friends, ſo much do <hi>I</hi> commend and eſteem thee.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ah!</hi> anſwer'd the other, <hi>This Requeſt is ſo much out of Reaſon, that <hi>I</hi> ought by no means to diſpute it with thee. Therefore amuſe thy ſelf no longer to preach, but regard, for what end thou com'ſt to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Is it ſo?</hi> ſaid he in the black Arms: <hi>Come on then.</hi> And uttering this word, they charg'd one another with ſuch vigor, that there was never ſeen a fiercer Fight: for during the ſpace of above two long hours, they ceas'd not to cut and thruſt, unjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting each others Armor, and paring their Shields in ſuch manner, that the Place was up and down cover'd with the Pieces which flew from them, ſo that it could not be judg'd, to which of them the Victory was promis'd: for the longer they fought, the more eager they ſeem'd to be: whence it hapned, that they were by the heat of the Sun (it being now Noon) ſo ſcalded in their Harneſs, that they were forc'd to draw back, and lift up the Viſors of their Helmets to take breath. But this laſted not long, ere they charg'd again with more Fury, than before; yet could not either of them gain any advantage over the other: at which being extremely vext within themſelves, they let go their Swords, leaving them hanging at their wriſts in Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Chains, and cloſing, endeavour'd each by his ſtrength and skill in wreſtling to throw his Adverſary on the ground: which 'twas impoſſible for them to do, both of them ſtanding ſo ſtifly, that the King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> running to <hi>Frandalo,</hi> whoſe weakneſs caus'd him to keep his Chamber, ſaid to him: <hi>If you can but come into theſe Galleries, you will ſee (perhaps) the cruelſt Fight, that can poſſibly be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ween two perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frandalo</hi> wondring what it might be, made a ſhift to crawl thit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then they ſtrove, who ſhould get the advantage; but in vain: for one was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner got uppermoſt, but he preſently found himſelf again underneath. Thus ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſometimes above, ſometimes under, they grew ſo out of breath, that they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, and riſing up, took their Swords again, with which they acted ſo valiantly as if they had not ſtriken a ſtroke all that day before. Which made <hi>Frandalo</hi> to who the King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had related all the beginning of this Diſpute, conjecture that he in the black Arms was <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaul.</hi> But he ſoon chang'd this Opinion: for <hi>Amadis</hi> was indeed of leſs Stature, and in too far a Countrey: wherefore he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that it was rather <hi>Liſvart</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> who had made this attempt.

To obviate which, ſhe proſtrated her ſelf at the Feet of him in the Black Arms, ſpeaking to him in this manner: <hi>Sir, my father, who loves and eſteems you, commanded me to do you this Honour, aſſuring me that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Damſel,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>if you know me not at preſent, I know very well, who you are, we having often diſcours'd together at a more agreeable time. As for the reſt, you may eaſily ſee, I have no power over this Knight, to pray him, or command him, conſidering the State we are in: wherefore I am of opinion; that you your ſelf ſpeak to him, and know what he thinks of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It ſhall not ſtick there,</hi> ſaid the Damſel. Then turning her Face towards him in the white Arms, ſhe ſaid to him: <hi>Knight, the Old Man, who found you in the Forreſt, after you had deliver'd King</hi> Magadan, <hi>deſires you for a reaſon to fight no more againſt him, to whom I have addreſt my ſelf, but to remember the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe you had with him, when you ſaid, that <hi>Vertue was never loſt, in what place ſoever it were exercis'd.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Damſel,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>I am ſo much bound to the old man, that I will believe his Counſel, and would gladly be in place, where I may do him Service as I deſire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now he had taken notice of the Honour, ſhe did the black Knight, which made him conjecture, that he was ſome King, or other great Perſonage, wherefore he ſaid to him: <hi>My Lord, pardon me, I beſeech you, if in my Behaviour and Words I have not been ſo courteous to you as I ought, and do me the Favour to tell me, who you are, that I may hereafter better know by name, him, in whom there is ſo much Goodneſs and Proweſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knight,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>your ſo glorious Diſcretion makes me entirely loſe the ill will, I have hitherto born you, and ſummons me to leave you the Place, ſince our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute can take no other courſe: Yet I will firſt ſatisfy your Requeſt, and tell you, who I am, on condition, that afterwards neither you, nor any other ſhall hinder my Departure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of that you may be ſure,</hi> ſaid the white Knight, <hi>and I promiſe you it upon my Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Underſtand then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that you may now ſee</hi> Eſplandian <hi>Emperor of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, <hi>who came hither, hoping alone to recover, what your ſelf have gain'd from me, and mine: but finding, what is in you, and knowing the Strength of the Place, I make no farther acccount of getting any thing, what Power ſoever I can bring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O</hi> Iupiter, cry'd out the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword, is it poſſible, that the Prince whoſe Renown is the greateſt, and moſt glorious of any in the whole world, has done me this Honour! On my faith, I may at preſent well ſtile my ſelf the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt man on earth, having had the Means to prove my ſelf againſt the beſt Knight living. Ah! Ah! moſt Excellent Emperor! You are ſuch, that the Praiſes, which are given you, are far ſhort, of what is due to your Merits. And would to our Gods, the Law, you hold, were conformable to their Honour, that you might in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:154293:30"/> time ſee, with what affection I would do you Service, inſtead of the Diſpleaſure, you have receiv'd thro' my ignorance: for which I entreat you, and this Damſel to excuſe me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now he believ'd her to be ſtill behind him; but ſhe was already departed, which he perceiv'd, as he thought to give her thanks: wherefore with much diſcontent he chang'd his diſcourſe, and askt, what way ſhe had taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſaid one from within, <hi>She is gone forth, and we ſaw her deſcend ſtrait to the Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ah!</hi> ſaid the Knight, <hi>ſhe does me wrong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now he thought to know of her, where he might find the good old <hi>Alquif,</hi> by whom he hop'd to come to the Knowledge of his Parents. And for this cauſe leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Emperor, he went haſtily out of the Caſtle, running after her, and the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he went, the more he ſaid within himſelf: <hi>By my Head, I have no wound, that ſhall hinder me from following you: and if once I catch you, you ſhall tell me, where your Father is.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>FRandalo,</hi> who was come down out of the Galleries, to liſten to the Damſels diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, having heard from the Emperor <hi>Eſplandians</hi> own mouth, that it was he who had fought with the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> preſently kneel'd down to kiſs his Hands, the King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> alſo making him a very great Reverence.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ah Sir,</hi> ſaid <hi>Frandalo, your Preſence gives me an incomparable Joy, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret even to Death,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My good Friend,</hi> ſaid the Emperor, <hi>you have always be eſteem'd ſo diſcreet, that you need not any Comfort, but what you can give your ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they had not long continu'd this Diſcourſe, when the twenty <hi>Turks</hi> lately arriv'd for Defence of the Place, calling out to Arms, ran upon the Emperor: who, more aſtoniſht than before, and that not without cauſe, ſaid to the King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whom he ſuſpected to be the Head of this Treaſon: <hi>How, Brother, Dare you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed do an Act, ſo injurious to your Honour, and the Right of Chivalry? On my faith you not only wrong your own Perſon, but all others, who bear the Title of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:154293:31"/> Gentlemen for you cannot be ignorant, that I entred into this place with Security from him, who had power to give me it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> very ſorry for this aſſault, took ſuddenly his Sword in hand, and ſeverely menac'd theſe Raſcals: who, to ſhew how little they would do for him, began in ſuch manner to let fly their Arrows, that they ſeem'd like Hail, pouring down from Heaven. This ſo chaf'd the Emperor, that without any farther delay, he cover'd himſelf with his Shield, and with Sword in hand entred pell mell amongſt them, ſtriking ſo on the right and left, that he gave the firſt, he met with, ſuch a blow, that he never ſpake after, and following the reſt, brought three of them with their Noſes to the ground. Nevertheleſs this could not have preſerv'd him without <hi>Frandalo,</hi> who, weak and feeble as he was, got hold of a Battle ax, and follow'd by two of his Squires, ſo well ſeconded the Emperor, that whether the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would or no, they were forc'd to give back, to their great ſhame and loſs. And as we often ſee a campany of Pies perſue an Hawk, that, taking his flight from off his Maſters hand, pearches upon ſome Tree, at his departure from which being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd by their beating and pecking at him, he not only ſeizes upon one, two, or three of them, but furiouſly ſcatters the Remainder: in the like manner theſe Raſcals, having done their endeavour againſt the Emperor, betook themſelves to flight, ſome falling dead, and others putting all their hopes in the entrance of a ſtair caſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they retir'd for their Defence. But this weak Reſiſtance laſted ſcarce a moment, the Emperor and <hi>Frandalo</hi> following them ſo cloſe, that there did not one of them eſcape.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was then in very great perplexity, fearing, leſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror might impute it to him, that he had been the Author of ſo great a Villany: of which being deſirous to excuſe himſelf, before he was ſpoken to about it, he went to meet the Emperor, and ſaid to him: <hi>Sir, I humbly beſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Truly,</hi> anſwer'd the Emperor, <hi>theſe Wretches have ſufficiently ſhewn, how little they know to maintain the Fidelity, requiſite amongſt Knights, and they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo been very well recompens'd, and chaſtis'd for it.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:154293:31"/> the Sea, where the King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> diſcover'd a vaſt Fleet of Ships, and other warlike Equipage, which <hi>Eſplandian</hi> had brought for Recovery of that Place: But would, before he laid Siege to it, endeavour to regain it by the means you have heard: for which purpoſe he went into a Skiff, taking no other Company with him, but one Eſquire, and <hi>Carmella,</hi> who ſtaid for him at the Gate, into which ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, when ſhe perceiv'd the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> go out.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ah! Sir,</hi> anſwer d King <hi>Norandel, how then have you loſt him ſo ſoon? cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly your Court would have been much honour'd, if you had ſtaid him for yours.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus did the Emperor diſcourſe of him, whoſe Grand-father he was, tho' not knowing it: and ſo long did he continue in the <hi>Defend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For this cauſe he addreſt himſelf to him, and without ſaluting him, us'd this Language:</hi> Sir Knight, are not you he, who, living againſt the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Law, have not long ſince forc'd the <hi>Defended Mountain?</hi> Certainly I will end<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Having ſaid this, he took his Shield, and ran upon him</hi> of the Burning Sword, <hi>who, without being any way diſmaid, anſwer'd him bravely:</hi> By my Head, I know not who you are: but I have ſeen many as brave as you, who at the end of the Fight have been cool enough, and yet without choller: therefore take heed, leſt the like befal you.</p>
               <p>That will appear, <hi>reply'd the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then they ſo furiouſly aſſaulted each other, that never two Stags, heated at the Rut for love of the Hind, ſhew'd themſelves more furious. So that after many blows ſtruck, Fortune would, that he of the Fountain ſhould have the better, giving his Adverſary two ſuch ſtrokes, that, whether he would or no, he fell in a ſwound, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing depriv'd of all knowledge. Which the</hi> Knight of the Burning Sword <hi>ſeeing, he went on to take off his Helmet, and afterwards his Head. But</hi> Frandamella <hi>(ſo was ſhe nam'd, who had long beheld them) began to cry out, and with the Tears trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in abundance down her Cheeks, askt pardon for the vanquiſht Knight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Damſel my Friend, <hi>anſwer'd he</hi> of the burning Sword, I will not refuſe you, but you ſhall be obey'd: for I have never learnt to be diſcourteous to Ladies, nor will I begin with you; tho' the Knight deſerves great Chaſtiſement, having aſſaulted me who never in my life injur'd him, as I know of. I ſhall only in recompence deſire you to tell me his Name: for by his Rich Armor, joyn'd with the Valour and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I have found in him, I gueſs him to be ſome great Perſonage.</p>
               <p>Ah, Ah, good Knight, <hi>reply'd ſhe,</hi> this I will willingly do on condition, that you alſo grant me a Gift, which will not I think be any way diſpleaſing to you: for if you are he, whoſe Renown flies thro' the whole World, I am in a manner aſſur'd that you will without conſtraint accord it me, when you know it.</p>
               <p>Damſel, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> you ſhall have of me, whatever you will nor ſhall the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your Religion and mine hinder it, provided your Requeſt be reaſonable and diſcreet? for <hi>I</hi> and all others, who bear Arms, and the Name of Knight, are ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:154293:33"/> oblig'd to maintain Right, and to do our utmoſt for Ladies; otherwiſe the Strength given us by the Gods, would deſerve no more praiſe, than that weakneſs and impuiſſance, which is ſo peculiar in you, that you cannot without us reſiſt the Wicked.</p>
               <p>Ah vertuous Knight, <hi>anſwer'd ſhe,</hi> you have ſpoken ſo well, that I ſhall eſteem you for it, as long as <hi>I</hi> live. And as to what you deſire to know concerning the Knight, you ſhall underſtand, that he is natural King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> nam'd <hi>Alpatracy,</hi> Husband to one of the moſt noble Princeſſes of <hi>Europe,</hi> call'd <hi>Miramynia,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King of <hi>Metz</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and they two were ſome time ſince enchanted by the Sage <hi>Medea:</hi> but about twenty years ago, the beſt Knight and faireſt Lady in the world deliver'd them out of that pain, the Knight, of whom <hi>I</hi> ſpeak, gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Helmet, and the Lady a Crown of ineſtimable value. But as one Unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs often accompanies another, King <hi>Alpatracy</hi> and his Queen living peaceably in their Countrey, bleſt with one only Daughter, which GOD had given them, more divinely accompliſht in all Perfections, than any other Creature in the world, it happen'd that the King of <hi>Metz</hi> died, by whoſe Death <hi>Miramynia,</hi> his ſole Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Heireſs, became Queen and Lady of his Countreys, which are large and rich, as having been given for Apennage to a ſecond Son of <hi>France:</hi> for from <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramond,</hi> who firſt took the Title of King over the <hi>French,</hi> deſcended, as I have many times heard, <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Meroveus.</hi> This <hi>Meroveus</hi> had three legitimate Sons, who, when their Father was dead, divided this great Monarchy betwixt them, ſo that the Kingdom of <hi>Metz</hi> came to the ſecond, who was Father of the Queen, that is VVife to this Knight. And for this reaſon he was ſometimes nam'd, and entitled King of <hi>Metz</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is not long ſince <hi>Alpatracy</hi> took poſſeſſion of it, and receiv'd an Oath of Fidelity from all his Subjects. But as he was returning into <hi>Sicily,</hi> he had News, that a near Relation of the Queens was revolted, and had taken by ſurprize the principal Towns of the Realm, under color of a certain pretended Law, eſtabliſht and ordain'd, as they ſay, by the ſaid <hi>Pharamond,</hi> by which the Traytor affirms, that the Realm of <hi>France</hi> muſt never fall to the Diſtaff, and that the Kingdom of <hi>Metz</hi> is ſubject alſo to the ſame Statute, as being a Member and Part of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy.</p>
               <p>This News was as pleaſing to the King, as you may imagin it to be; yet he hop'd to avenge himſelf throughly on the Traytor, which he would eaſily have done, had not a ſecond and worſe Misfortune diverted him. VVhich was, that the Queen <hi>Miramynia,</hi> and her Daughter, as they were hunting in the Forreſt, near <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſſa,</hi> were ſurpris'd by <hi>Frandalon</hi> the <hi>Cyclops,</hi> and his Son, two horrible and mercileſs Gyants, who mauger the Huntſmen and others, ſent away the two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Priſoners into the Iſle of <hi>Silanchy,</hi> where they are yet at preſent. And theſe Devils have ſent word to the King, that he ſhall never recover them, unleſs he come with another, and fight with them concerning the Right, they pretend to the Realm and Countrey of <hi>Sicily,</hi> which, they ſay, belongs to them, as having
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:154293:33"/> been at firſt peopled, and inhabited by their Anceſtors: and if they ſhall be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſht, they will reſtore the Ladies: but if the King and his Second, ſhall have the worſt, he ſhall be conſtrain'd, and oblig'd by Oath, to ſurrender into their hands the Countrey, they claim, to be enjoy'd by them, as their own, without Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, how this poor Prince has been treated by Fortune, which has in a moment depriv'd him of Countrey, VVife, and Child, which he loves, and eſteems dearer than his own Perſon: ſo that he has been even ready to dye thro' exceſſive Sorrow. Deſirous however to ſhew the Magnanimity of his Courage, and that not Time, but Vertue, appeas'd his grief, he has ſo far recomforted himſelf, that he has undertaken the Combat againſt the two Gyants. And for this Reaſon he was ſailing towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> hoping to obtain of the Emperor ſome Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his, to ſecond him againſt the <hi>Cyclops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it hapned that traverſing the Strait of the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> we met a Galley, that was bound for <hi>Great B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The King was ſo troubl'd at this news for the Amity, there is between him and the Emperor, that he would come aſhore, and landing over-againſt the mouth of this ſtream, ſaw the Forreſt ſo ſhady, that, thinking to find pleaſure in it, he has been more ſeverely handled, than I ſhould have imagin'd.</p>
               <p>I have now ſo well ſatisfied your Demands, that there remains nothing but the Accompliſhment of your promiſe, which will ſerve only to augment your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and renown. My humble Requeſt therefore is, that you will be pleas'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the King into the Iſle of <hi>Silanchy,</hi> and contribute your Aſſiſtance for the Deliverance of the Queen my Miſtreſs. Which will be eaſie for you to effect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Proweſs, I have with mine own Eyes ſeen to be in you, who have in this manner ſubdu'd him; whom I have heard eſteem'd one of the valianteſt men on earth.</p>
               <p>In good faith, Damſel, <hi>anſwer'd the</hi> Knight of the burning Sword, this I ſo willingly granted you, that, had you not deſir'd it, <hi>I</hi> ſhould my ſelf have requeſted it of you, having heard the Nature of the Affair: which if I could bring to an end, I ſhould aſſuredly account my ſelf one of the happieſt Knights living. For ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that thoſe, who have forc'd away the Queen, and her Daughter, be of the ſame Religion with my ſelf, yet would I not ſupport them in their wickedneſs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving receiv'd Knight-hood with no other Intention, but to employ my Endeavors for the Relief of thoſe, that ſuffer wrong and injuſtice. And therefore let us go, where you pleaſe, and I ſhall willingly accompany you, whatever Buſineſs I have in theſe Parts.</p>

And if you will do me ſo much Favour, as this Damſel aſſures me, you ſhall always have a King for your Friend, and ready to do you any Pleaſure: for I have ſuch Hope in your high Proweſs, that I am in a manner ſecure, by your means to recover the thing, which I love, and eſteem dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than my ſelf, and for loſs of which I have already undergone a Diſcontent, and Sorrow, worſe than Death.</p>
               <p>Sir, <hi>anſwer'd he,</hi> I will follow you, where ever you ſhall command me, not ſo much to accompany and ſerve you, as to acquit my ſelf of what Reaſon enjoyns me: for altho' by reaſon of the Real Dignity, that is in you, every inferior Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought to ſerve you; nevertheleſs the difference of the Religion, I profeſs, from that, in which you live, forbids me to favour or aſſiſt you; but not to ſuccour the Afflicted, in whoſe Number I reckon you: and for this good work alone I will put my ſelf in hazard of death, when occaſion ſhall offer.</p>

                  <hi>Now</hi> Alpatracy <hi>was ſo wounded, that he was ſcarce able to ſtand upon his Legs: wherefore the Knight and Damſel took him under the Arms, and with exceeding great difficulty got him back to his Ships, where his wounds were viewed by the Chirurgions, who took ſuch care of them, that they were ſoon heal'd, as were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thoſe of the</hi> Knight of the Burning Sword, <hi>who had alſo had ſuch a ſhare in the Cake, that he was fain to keep his Bed.

But, when they could not give him any Aſſurance, he, tir'd with the Fatigue of that tedious Storm, and ſeeing the Countrey ſufficiently pleaſant, deſir'd the King to go a Shore: which was no unpleaſing Requeſt to him. Arming themſelves therefore, they caus'd their Horſes to be taken out of the Ship, on which they mounted, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves carrying their Arms and Shields: for they had not any Company with them, but <hi>Frandamella,</hi> having commanded all the reſt to ſtay for them, and not ſtir from thence: Being entred into the Forreſt, they had not travell'd far, ere they met a Damſel, bitterly lamenting a Knight, whom ſhe bare before her on her Hackney, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much wounded in his Head, on which ſhe held her hand, to ſtop the too great effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Blood.

               <p>This ſaid, ſhe paſs'd on, and left the two Knights laughing together, at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, ſhe had given them.

                  <p>How the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> fought one after another with the Dutcheſſes Knight: and what befel of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Knight, that kept the Paſſage, as you have been told, having heard the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers Anſwer, and ſeeing the King of <hi>Sicily</hi> ready to perform his Devoir, took his Courſe againſt him: and their Meeting was with ſuch impetuoſity, that their Spears, piercing each others Shield, ſhiver'd to pieces, their Bodies joining ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, that the Knight of the Kay loſt a Stirrup and the King came to the ground being ſquatted on the graſs. Yet he very lightly got up again, and putting his hand to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am well content,</hi> anſwer'd the other.</p>
               <p>Then he ſat foot to ground, and without any farther delay there began between them a very fierce Combat, which continu'd the ſpace of a long half hour, before it could be perceiv'd, which would have the better, or the worſe: Nevertheleſs a little after the King began to be ſo enfeebled, that he knew he could not much longer reſiſt without being ſlain or vanquiſht: to obviate which he drew a little aſide, and ſaid to him of the Kay: <hi>Knight, pray let us take breath: The day is long enough for us to finiſh this Diſpute in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Combat,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>is more for pleaſure than Enmity: Therefore I grant you this ſatisfaction, altho' I have no need of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King, hearing this gracious Anſwer, and very well knowing that it was true, bethought himſelf (the better to preſerve his Honour, and avoid the Danger) to cover with the vail of Courteſie, what he wanted in force, ſaying to him: <hi>In good faith, Knight, your Obligingneſs has ſo far vanquiſht me, that, conſidering your Enterp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Then he took it from his Neck, to preſent it to him: but the Knight of the Kay, putting it back with his hand, made him this Anſwer: <hi>Stay Knight, you ſhall not leave me your Shield, but if you pleaſe to let me have your Name, I ſhall eſteem it more than all the Wealth in the world, ſeeing the Proweſs, and great Civility, you are endu'd with: Not that I have vanquiſht you, who have your ſelf Conquer'd me, ſo that I ſhall be all my life indebted to you, in that you would not conſtrain me to quit this Paſſage: for I muſt have immediately retir'd, and loſt the Sight of the thing, I moſt love, which is my Lady.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he exactly related to him his Intention, in the ſame manner the Dutcheſs had told it to the Emperor <hi>Eſplandian</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:154293:36"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>In good faith,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>had I known ſo much, you ſhould have yet had a better bargain of me: for I have my ſelf with a thouſand labours too much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Evil, Love works through the leaſt disfavour of the belov'd Object. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand then, that I am</hi> Alpatracy, <hi>King of</hi> Sicily, <hi>and</hi> Metz, <hi>arriv'd not ten hours ſince on theſe Coaſts, and that not intentionally, but by the greateſt Adventure ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. If therefore you pleaſe to ſpare your ſelf the combating my Companion, I will prevail ſo far with him, that for my ſake he ſhall forbear it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Knight, very glad of the Intelligence, he receiv'd from <hi>Alpatracy,</hi> not ſo much becauſe he was a King, as becauſe he had heard him accounted one of the beſt Warriours in the World, anſwer'd him: <hi>Sir, I cannot ſufficiently thank your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty for the Honour you do me, who am but a ſimple Gentleman, and you ſo great a Prince, that I ſhall eſteem my ſelf happy to go and ſerve you in</hi> France <hi>or</hi> Sicily, <hi>as ſoon as I ſhall have ſatisfied my Lady, and of that you may aſſure your ſelf: but as to your Offer of deſiring your Companion to deſiſt from conteſting with me, I beſeech you, Sir, to pardon me, and to be content, that I entertain the cuſtom of the Kay, being come hither for no other Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You ſhall do as you think beſt,</hi> anſwer'd the King: <hi>it ſuffices me, that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the promiſe, you have made me, to accompany me in the Conqueſt of my Kingdom of</hi> Metz, <hi>as ſoon as I ſhall have finiſht a Voyage, from which I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then were their Horſes brought them, on which, when they were mounted, the Dutcheſs approacht, to know, what Diſcourſe they had together, which her Knight recounted to her without omitting any thing, whereat ſhe greatly rejoyc'd. And in the mean time he, that came with <hi>Alpatracy,</hi> took ſuch pleaſure in beholding the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Beauty of this Princeſs, that he remembred not that he was to Fight, when the Knight of the Kay, who perceiv'd it, call'd to him, ſaying: <hi>Sir Knight, you have mus'd long enough for once: The cuſtom of this Place requires ſomething elſe, than muſing on Ladies Beauties. Think, Sir, on what you are come for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as he utter'd theſe words, he went to the Elm, againſt which the Lances ſtood, and choſe from amongſt them the ſtrongeſt, he could find. Then <hi>Alpatracy</hi>'s Companion well knew, that the Knight of the Kay was a little ſtung with Iealouſy, nevertheleſs he took ſo unpatiently this Remonſtrance, that he retir'd back far enough to take a Career, and then ſeeing his Adverſary ready, ſet ſpurs to his Horſe, as the other alſo did, encountring each other with ſo much vigour, that they both brake their Spears. Then turning their Bridles, the ſtrange Knight was putting his Hand to his Sword, when he of the Kay deſir'd him to juſt ſo long, till one, or both of them came to the Ground: to which he readily conſented. The Servants then and Eſquires advanc'd to bring 'em new Lances, and they brake each of them ſix ſtaves, without ſtirring from their Saddles. This ſo enrag'd them both, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth charge, their Spears being broken to the very handles, they had ſuch a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of Shields, Bodies, and Heads, their Horſes alſo meeting Head to Head, and Shoulder to Shoulder, that they both fell ſtunny'd on the graſs. Yet the two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:154293:37"/> ſoon got up again, and embracing their Shields, fell furiouſly ſo to hew and hack each other, that in a ſhort time the place was all over cover'd with the Plates and Pieces of their Haubergeons and Coars of Mail. The <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> had indeed a very great Advantage over the other, the Shield, which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him by the Damſel in the Forreſt, being of ſuch a Temper, that neither Lance nor Sword could make any impreſſion on it. Nevertheleſs he of the Kay behav'd himſelf with ſo much courage, that for the ſpace of above a long hour it could not be diſcern'd, who would have the better.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were thus in the heat of their Engagement, there arriv'd King <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> and Queen <hi>Oriana,</hi> attended by a great company of Ladies, Gentlewomen, and Knights, who, having heard of the extraordinary Proweſs of him, that kept the Kay, were come from <hi>London</hi> to ſee this Paſtime, with purpoſe not to part thence in a Weeks time. They perceiv'd then the two Combatants in the Condition, I told you, wherefore they ſtood ſtill to ſee, which of them would gain the Honour of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, King <hi>Amadis</hi> himſelf not knowing what to think of it, ſeeing them ſo full of Animoſity one againſt the other. Nor was his wonder a little increaſt, when he was told, that they had been above two hours in theſe Tranſports, without taking the leaſt Repoſe, or Breath, ſo that the beſt, they could expect, was the ſpeedy Death of one of them, if not of both together. Which ſo aſtoniſht the Dutcheſs, that ſhe knew not what countenance to keep, tho' ſhe put on a ſmiling and aſſured look, the better to keep her Knight in heart: who, willing to leave nothing unattempted, us'd all imaginable Endeavours to vanquiſh his Enemy. But his Adverſary was too ſtrong, and pretending alſo to the ſame End, at which he aim'd, preſs'd him ſo cloſe that he now no longer did any thing, but parry his Shield to the others Blows: at which the Dutcheſs, as deſpairing of his ſafety, ſo exceedingly chang'd colour, that he perceiv'd it, and entred into ſuch a Rage, that reſolving to win the Horſe or loſe the Saddle, he took his Sword in both hands, and ſtruck his Enemy with ſo much fo ce, that he made him ſet his knee to the ground. Yet he got nimbly up again, and, to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>enge himſelf, ſo handled the other, that his Armor was in no place of ſtrength enough, to hinder the Edge of his Enemies Sword from piercing to the quick, ſo that it was plainly to be ſeen, that, if he perſiſted any longer, his Death was near.</p>
               <p>Now, as he was in ſuch extremity, there came in great haſt a Damſel, Riding on a Palfrey, who at her approach cry'd out as loud, as ſhe could: <hi>Hola, Knights, hola, hear, what I have to ſay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this cry the two Combatants drew back a little from each other, and the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, addreſſing her ſelf to the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> askt him, if he did not know her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yes ſurely do I,</hi> anſwer'd he: <hi>for you have this day given me the beſt Shield in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true,</hi> reply'd the Damſel, <hi>and I am come to demand of you the Gift, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd me; which is, that without any delay you leave this Combat in the Condition it is in, and return with your Companion to your Mariners, who expect you.</hi>

               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:154293:37"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>In good faith Damſel,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>you are very ſhort with me, yet I will ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy you, what ever may come of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Scarce had he utter'd this word, when the Damſel, turning her Bridle and whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping her Palfrey, entred the Forreſt, and got ſoon out of ſight, leaving the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> diſpleas'd even to death, for being hindred to proſecute his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured Victory: for his word having oblig'd him, he would not for any thing in the world infringe it. Wherefore having again mounted his Horſe, he and the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd back to the Sea-ſide, thinking well, that the Damſel had not without myſtery appeas'd this Quarrel. Being then come to their Ships, and having caus'd their wounds to be dreſt, they commanded their Marriners to weigh Anchor, and hoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Now becauſe King <hi>Amadis</hi> had not ſeen the Combat between the Knight and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patracy,</hi> and that he was told, how they had made Peace together, he askt the Knight of the Kay, whether he knew him, and the other alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwer'd the Knight, <hi>He in the rich Arms is the King of</hi> Sicily; <hi>but of his Companion I know nothing, ſave that he has given me the beſt Rubbing <hi>I</hi> ever had in my life.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>In good faith,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>he is a gallant man, and <hi>I</hi> am very glad of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, which thus parted you: Yet had <hi>I</hi> thought that the King of</hi> Sicily <hi>was in theſe parts, he ſhou d have kept us company a little longer, unleſs he had poſitively refus'd me: for <hi>I</hi> love and eſteem him, as one of the beſt Princes on the Earth.</hi>

               <p>The King, who had never before ſeen them, embrac't them, and gave them a very good Reception, ſaying to them: <hi>I <hi>am indeed very glad of this your good Will, and accept it very kindly.</hi>

                  <hi>He will be found again ſome other time,</hi> ſaid the King, and went immediately to viſit the Knight of the Kay, into whoſe Tent he had ſcarce ſet foot, when there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred a Damſel, Siſter to <hi>Farineus</hi> of <hi>Carſantum,</hi> who, having left her Brother in the Chirurgeons hands, came to give the King notice, ſhe had met the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> for ſhe knew by Report, that he had conquer'd the <hi>Defended Mountain.</hi> And for this cauſe, as ſoon as ſhe ſaw <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſhe fell down on her knees, and ſaid to him: <hi>Sir, the Knight who, as they ſay, fought</hi> Frandalo, <hi>and his People, is to my certain knowledge in this Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is he ſo?</hi> ſaid the King: <hi>and have you ſeen him?</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Yes Sir,</hi> anſwer'd the Damſel</p>
               <p>Then ſhe related to the King, how ſhe met him in the Forreſt, as ſhe was carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Brother: <hi>And for the greater certainty,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>he had yet his Shield with the Burning ſword, and was accompany'd by another in the richeſt Armor, I ever ſaw in my Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Never truſt me,</hi> anſwer'd the King, <hi>if it were not he, that thus ſeverely treated
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:154293:38"/> our Knight, having chang'd his Arms the better to conceal himſelf: But had <hi>I</hi> known him, I would have given him the Honour, and good Entertainment, he merits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet he ſpake againſt his own Conſcience: for he would have undoubtedly put him to death, not being able to forget the Childs Threatning, which I juſt now mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: for which cauſe he would have ſent after him, had he not remembred the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, the Damſel made him, to return to his Ship. Now there were many good Knights, who knowing, that the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> was thus eſcap'd, without being any farther try d in Great <hi>Britain,</hi> were very much diſpleas'd: for they would willingly have combated him, to know by experience, whether, what Fame reported of him, were true. And he of the Kay promis d himſelf, that, after he had recover'd his Health, and acquitted himſelf of his Oath to the Dutcheſs, he would not ſtay in any place, till he had found him, and fought him again. Nor was it long ere he was ſtrong enough to bear Arms: which being come to the knowledge of King <hi>Amadis,</hi> he told <hi>Orizenes</hi> and <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Dutcheſs, ſeeing this, ſent her Meſſenger to acquaint them with the uſual Covenants whom they anſwer'd, that they would for this reaſon paſs the Kay.

                  <p>How the Knight of the Kay vanquiſht <hi>Orizenes</hi> and <hi>Bravartus,</hi> who came to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault him in diſguiſe, and of that which hapned.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Overthrow of the ſix foregoing Knights gave ſuch an Example to light Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers, that for four days after not one preſented himſelf to hazard his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation againſt him, whom they nam'd <hi>The Wont to overcome.</hi> Nevertheleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Week was out, as King <hi>Amadis,</hi> newly riſen from Table, was walking along a Gallery, he deſcry'd far enough off, two Knights advantageouſly arm'd and mounted: To whom the Dutcheſs (according to the Cuſtom) ſent her Damſel Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, to acquaint them with the Place, by which they were to paſs, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, to which they were oblig'd. She, who was no Apprentice in ſuch Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades, did what ſhe was commanded; but the Knights anſwer'd her, that they came for no other purpoſe: wherefore ſhe return'd.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Dutcheſſes Knight took one of the biggeſt Lances, he could find, and ſetting Spurs to his Horſe, ran ſo vigorouſly againſt him, who preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that their Shields were pierc't, and their Staves broken to the very Gantlet, diſjointing their Armors even to the Fleſh, without receiving any other hurt, as they well gave to underſtand: for at the end of their Career they turn'd about, and putting their hands to their Swords, began to treat one another, not as in a Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for Pleaſure, but as if they had fought for ſome Quarrel, which they were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to maintain with their Lives. Nor was it a little Honour, that the Knight of the Forreſt gain'd there: for, during the Space of a long hour and above, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd himſelf ſo valiantly, that the Dutcheſſes Knight knew not where he was. Wherefore irritated with extream Choler, he lift up his Sword, and thinking to beat down the other, ruſht upon him with all his force; but he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And as the Knight of the Kay was alighting, to make him ſwear the Performance of the uſual Covenants, the other cry'd out, that he accorded him both his Name and his Shield, ſince Fortune had ſo disfavour'd him through the fault of his Steed.</p>
               <p>Then there came Servants and Squires, who freed him out of this little eaſe, and he ſtood by with a great deal of Confuſion, expecting what would befall his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:154293:39"/> againſt him, both gallantly breaking their Spears; but their Meeting was ſuch, that the Dutcheſſes Knight loſt one of his Stirrups, being ready to fall, had he not caught hold of his Horſes Mane. The others luck was yet worſe: for he and his Steed were in one moment overthrown, ſo that they were both thought to have broken their Necks, which gave the Dutcheſſes Knight great occaſion to alight, and ſee how it was. Yet could he not make ſo much haſt, but that his Adverſary was got on his Feet, and with his Sword in hand, and Shield before him, fully determin'd to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the Injury he had ſuffer'd. Then they charg'd one another ſo furiouſly for three quarters of an hour together that it could not be known which of them had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Nevertheleſs they were fain in the end to reſt, tho' this Repoſe laſted but a little, e'er they began again their Diſpute with greater fierceneſs, than before: whence there proceeded ſuch Execution, that their Arms were batter'd, and unrivet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and their Fleſh in many places dy'd with Blood, altho' neither the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made (for all this) the leaſt ſhew of fear, but kept up yet a long hour, ſtill perſiſting to do better and better.</p>
               <p>But the Spectators were all amaz'd, ſeeing the Knight of the Forreſt, as he was giving a ſtep aſide, fall in a Swound to the ground, at which his Companion, who beheld him, being exceedingly diſcontented, as thinking him to be dead, made the greateſt mean imaginable, and throwing his Helmet far from him on the ground cry'd out ſo loud, that every one heard him: <hi>Alas! our fooliſh Preſumption has well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd us, and yet better chaſtis'd us: for we ought to conſider, that this is the beſt Knight in the World; and yet we were ſo temerarious, as unfortunately to ſet our ſelves againſt him.</hi>

               <p>Then were they known, the one to be <hi>Orizenes,</hi> and the other <hi>Bravartus,</hi> who (the better to make tryal of their Perſons againſt the Dutcheſſes Friend) had thus diſguis'd themſelves, and that to their Dammage: for they were both in danger to loſe their Lives, eſpecially <hi>Bravartus,</hi> who was incontinently diſarm'd, and ſo well lookt after, that he began to grow better than 'twas expected. Yet was not King <hi>Amadis</hi> pleas'd with their Folly, but privately remonſtrated to them, that they ought to have ſo born this Enterprize, conſidering the Experience, they had ſeen of the ſtrange Knight, who was no le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And I, who am in compariſon of them but a Dream, how much am I render'd yours by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, you do me? For by them has that Succeſsfulneſs in Feats of Arms, for which you give me ſo much Praiſe, been known to be in me, with all the reſt of that Goodneſs, if I am indu'd with any. I will therefore dye, but I will obtain the Rich Helmet, with the Sword, and Shield of value, which you promiſe to the beſt Combatant: well knowing, that, letting them be loſt, I ſhall loſe your Love, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever daring to appear before you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In good faith, my great Friend,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>you do me wrong, to doubt thus of my Conſtancy, ſince there is not any thing either in Heaven, or Earth, that can efface out of my mind the Good, I deſire you. And ſhould we happen by Fortune, or otherwiſe, to be ſeparated one from the other, believe me, I would at the ſame time ſeparate my Life from my Body, which is, and ſhall be yours to the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this manner did the Dutcheſs content her paſſionate Heart, expecting the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of her Knight, whom the King viſited almoſt every day.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Orizenes</hi> and <hi>Bravartus</hi> found themſelves ſome time after ſtrong enough to Travel: Wherefore they humbly beſought <hi>Amadis</hi> to give them leave, to go in queſt of <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaul,</hi> and <hi>Lifvart</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> which he willingly granted them. And for this cauſe, taking leave of the Court, they Embarkt in the Ship, in which they came, and hoiſing up Sail, Lancht forth into the open Sea, very much diſpleas'd at the Fortune they had, in their beginning to bear Arms; nevertheleſs conſidering the Valour of him, who had the Advantage over them, they bore this Trouble, the beſt they could.</p>

Such was the Accoutrement of this Virgin, whom the King courteouſly ſaluted: and yet ſhe regarded him not, but addreſt her ſelf to the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> whom ſhe ſaw without a Beard, and ſaid to him: <hi>Are you then he, who are to fight with the King againſt my Father and Brother?</hi>

               <p>Tho' the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> perceiv'd himſelf jeer'd, yet did he but laugh at it, ſaying to her: <hi>In faith Madam, if all the Beauties of this Countrey re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble you, it will never be thought, I came hither to make love, and much leſs, that You and I are one mans Children.</hi>

               <p>'Twas not long ere the two <hi>Ciclops</hi> approacht, the Father being mounted on a Beaſt, almoſt like a Dromedary, and having no other Arms, but a Shield of fine Steel, hanging about his Neck, and in his hand a Battle. Ax, maſſy, and weighty, fit for ſo genteel and gracious a Gentleman, as he was. So it is, that there was not ſeen in his time any man bigger than himſelf, nor had he any more Eyes than his Daughter: and for this reaſon was he alſo call'd <hi>Ciclops</hi> His Son, who was much leſs in Stature than himſelf, was Arm'd with a ſtrong Haubergeon. having a great Semiter at his Girdle, and bearing a ſtiff Lance on his Thigh. Now when they were come within a Career of the King, the Giant cry'd out to him as loud, as he could: <hi>Surrender to me my Countrey, if thou art wiſe, and enter willingly into my Priſons, or thou ſhalt dye piteouſly by my hands, and the Villian alſo, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies thee.</hi>

               <p>At this word the Knight pull'd down his Viſor, and ran with ſuch ſtr ngth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Frandalon,</hi> that he nail'd his Shield and Thigh together: Nevertheleſs the Giant thought, as he paſs'd, to be even with him, and ſeparate him in two; but as he lifted up his Arm, the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> avoided the Blow, and the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:154293:42"/> Ax fell in vain, their Bodies meeting with ſuch force, that <hi>Frandalon,</hi> wounded and weakned in his Leg, could not keep his Saddle, no more than could the Knight, who with this great Sheck, and by the ſtrength of his Lance, the Girths and Bows of his Saddle breaking, was carry'd over his Horſes Crupper, tho' without receiving any farther hurt. Yet was he not at all contented with his Fortune, but getting up in a rage, ſet his hand to his Sword to ſtrike <hi>Frandalon,</hi> who being thus wounded, as you have heard could not ſtand on his Feet, but was fain to ſit on the ground, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping nevertheleſs an aſſured look, and giving the Knight at his approach ſo great a Blow, that had he not ſupported himſelf by clapping down his right hand, he had faln flat on the ground. But before the Giant could recover his Ax, the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> taking him unprovided, cleft his Head aſunder, he having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Headpiece, nor Cap to ſave it.</p>
               <p>His Son (who had not ſtir'd till then, nor yet the King, the better to behold the Combat of the two others) ſeeing this, was ſo ſurpriz'd, and inflam'd with Choler, that he ran with full ſpeed againſt <hi>Alpatracy,</hi> to whom he gave ſo great a blow with his Lance, that wounding him ſeverely in the Breaſt, he threw him to the Ground: At which the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> exceedingly diſcontented, as doubting him to be dead, reſolv'd to revenge him; but the young <hi>Cyclops</hi> little car'd for it, thinking ſoon to bring him to Reaſon. And for this cauſe couching his Spear, he thought at leaſt by running his Horſe over him to example him down, when the Knight, who was nimble and qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But the <hi>Knight of the Burning ſword</hi> was more ſucceſsful, ſtriking the Giant ſo home with his great Ax, that cleaving down his right Shoulder, he parted his Soul from his Bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then the Conqueror came to the King, whom <hi>Frandamella</hi> held in her lap in a Swound; nevertheleſs as ſoon as his Helmet was taken off, that he might have Air, he began to breath again.</p>
               <p>Now the Queen <hi>Miramynia,</hi> and <hi>Lucella,</hi> had ſeen him overthrown, and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to be worſe than he was, wept and bewail'd him bitterly, and ſo loud, that the King heard them cry, and lament: Wherefore he took heart, and to recomfort them, got up, feigning that he felt not either Hurt or Pain. The ſame alſo he affirm'd to the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> who, ere he was aware, felt the Blow of a Mace given him by the Gianteſs, wife to <hi>Frandalon:</hi> for ſhe, knowing the Death of her Husband and Son, iſſu'd forth of the Caſtle, and being full of Rage and Deſpair, came ſecretly behind the Knight, thinking to beat out his Brains, and indeed the blow he receiv'd from her, was ſuch, that it made the very Fire fly out of his Eyes, He
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:154293:42"/> would not however ſtrike her with his Sword, but took a Truncheon of a Lane, with which he made her ſuch a Fly-ſlap, that ſhe began to Stagger, as if ſhe were giving up the Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Then the Knight left her, and return'd to the King, who embrac'd him, ſaying to him: <hi>Alas! Bleſſed be the day of your Birth: for beſides my Life, which you have ſav'd, I recover this day by your means, what I moſt prize of any thing in the World.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwer'd the Knight, <hi>give thanks only to your good Right: for I have done nothing, but what I was oblig'd to by reaſon. But does it not pleaſe you, that we go to the Queen, and my Lady your Daughter, whom I ſee at the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of yonder Tower: For I believe, they expect you with very great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Let us go then, I beſeech you,</hi> anſwer'd the King</p>
               <p>Then they went towards the Caſtle, and when they were come nigh, the Qugh call'd out to them, that they ſhould take the Keys from the Gianteſs, ſince they could not otherwiſe get into the Tower, in which, ſhe and her Daughter were enclos'd. The King therefore ſent <hi>Frandamella</hi> to ferth them: and in the mean time they went on into the outer Court, whither they were no ſooner got, but they heard their Damſel crying, and calling out for help: wherefore haſting towards her, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd her running with full ſpeed from the Gianteſs, who follow'd her, with the Truneheon of the Lance; ſo that the King and the Knight could not forbear laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſee the Race, that was between them. Nevertheleſs fearing, leſt <hi>Franda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mella</hi> might be out tag'd by the Gianteſs, they ſtept forward to ſave her: but the Gianteſs turn'd back croſs the Fields, carrying along with her the Keys of the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and running ſo faſt, that they could not overtake hee Moreover (the better to ſecure her ſelf) ſhe went ſo far into the Take which on one ſide environ'd the place, that the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> could not get near her; but giving her to all the Devils, return'd towards the King, who had in the mean time ſent <hi>Frandamel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> to the Shore, to fetch thence Ten of his Knights, who might force the Gianteſs.

               <p>They trembling through Exceſs of Fear, led them to an Iron Door, faſtned with

               <p>By this the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> well knew, that he ſhould never have her without ſome other Artifice: Wherefore he made them all Retire, and hoping to gain by words what he could not get by Arms, ſpeak to her in this manner: <hi>Lady, give us the Keys of the Tower, and I promiſe you on the faith of a Gentleman that you ſhall not receive any diſpleaſure; otherwiſe your Daughter ſhall pay her Head for your Folly.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> ſlew the Gianteſs, Wife to <hi>Frandalon</hi> the <hi>Cyclops,</hi> and fell in love with the fair <hi>Lucella,</hi> for whom he did afterwards many high Feats of Arms.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NIght being come, and the Knights betaking themſelves to their Repoſe, the King, whoſe Thoughts were ruminating on his Queen, and Daughter, that remain'd ſtill ſhut up without Food, or any means of being ſpeedily ſuccor'd, had not yet clos'd his Eyes, when he heard the Voice of one, who cry'd out for fear: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuddainly ſtarting up, he call'd out to the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>As I live, my dear Friend, I am greatly miſtaken, if they are not outraging the Queen: for I have heard a great cry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this the Knight roſe haſtily up, and taking his Sword in one hand, and a Flambeau in the other, ran to the Place, where he heard the Noiſe, and, as he was going down the ſtairs, ſaw the Gianteſs, who carried the Queen, and her Daughter under her two Arms, flying with all the ſpeed ſhe could toward the Lake. And the the Burthen was very heavy, yet ſhe made ſuch haſt, that he could not overtake her, till ſhe was gotten up to the knees in the Water: But then he ſo ſurpriz'd her, that ſhe never more parted thence, but immediately dy'd, letting the Queen and <hi>Lucella</hi> fall into the Water, of which they at that time Drank more than they did of Wine, In the mean time came the others, whom the King had likewiſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ak'd, and that juſt in the nick, as the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> was hard put to it, to ſave the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Daughter. Thus were the Ladies aſſiſted, and whilſt thoſe, that came laſt, took up the Queen, he carry'd <hi>Lucella</hi> to Land, whoſe Elegancy and excellent Beauty gain'd ſuch power over him, that he found himſelf ſeiz'd with Love, a thing very new to him, who had never till then experimented the force of that little god, who nevertheleſs treated him with ſo much Gentleneſs, (tho' contrary to his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom) that at the ſame time he inclin'd the heart of the Princeſs to a Reciprocal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, making her no leſs deſirous, than deſired. Nevertheleſs both the one and the other with great Prudence and Diſcretion carefully conceal'd this Paſſion, tho' the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> had no ſooner freed her out of Danger, and ſet her on firm Land, but (making her a great Reverence) he askt her, how ſhe did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alas! Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>my heart beats ſo vehemently, that I know not, whether I am dead, or living: For GOD's ſake conduct me to the King, and tell me whether he be much wounded: for when I ſaw him yeſterday, I was in great doubt of his ſafety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> anſwer'd the Knight, <hi>he is certainly wounded, but not ſo much, as you may think, and the Joy, he will receive by your preſence, will make him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the greateſt part of his pain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Indeed Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Lucella, you have ſo much oblig'd us, that we are bound to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:154293:44"/> you for ever, eſpecially I poor Gentlewoman, who never merited Favour of ſuch a Knight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ma am,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I ſhall eſteem my ſelf the happieſt man in the World, if you graciouſly accept the little I have done for your deliverance, ſince I am ſo much yours, that under your ſole Favour I reſolve henceforth to follow Arms, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, giving my ſelf the Glory to be ſervant to the faireſt Princeſs, this day living.</hi>

Then they Aſcended the Stairs, and went into the Room where the King lay ſick, who ſeeing the Queen and <hi>Lucella</hi> in good Health, was (as you may believe) ſo fill'd with Ioy, that his Speech fail'd him, and ſtretching out his Arms, as theſe two Ladies paid him their Reſpects, he embrac'd them, the one with his right hand, the other with his left, the Tears falling abundantly down his Cheeks.</p>
               <p>Then all of a ſuddain fetching a deep ſigh, he lifted up his Eyes to Heaven, and cry'd out: <hi>O Soveraign GOD! prais'd be your holy Name! ſince it has pleaſed you, after having deliver'd us out of the curſed Conjuration and Enchantment, in which the Sorcereſs</hi> Medea <hi>had put us, to grant me this farther Bleſſing, that I ſhould this day ſee with my eyes the two perſons, that are dearer to me than my own life. Ah! ah!</hi> Knight of the Burning Sword! <hi>How is it poſſible, that I ſhall ever be able to acknowledge the Benefit, I receive by your means? On my faith we are ſo much oblig'd to you, that we may with reaſon call you our ſecond Father, as having given us a new life: ſince without your Aſſiſtance we had been certainly loſt, theſe Ladies with ill Uſage, and I with Diſcontent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Queen and <hi>Lucella</hi> had not eaten any thing in two days: Wherefore the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> ſeeing that the King was entring into a Diſcourſe, which was like to hold him long, interpoſs'd, ſaying: <hi>Sir, your new Content makes you forget the long Time, that theſe Ladies have been without Food.

               <p>Then were the Tables cover'd, and in the mean time the Queen recited the fear, ſhe was in, till ſuch time ſhe ſaw the Gianteſs dead.</p>

Ah, ah! poor</hi> Knight of the Burning Sword! <hi>Haſt thou then hopes ever to receive cure?

               <argument>
                  <p>Of a Wonderful Adventure, that befel the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> the Queen, <hi>Lucella,</hi> and <hi>Frandamella,</hi> by which they were ſeparated from their Fleet, and in danger of being drown'd.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SIx whole Weeks Sail'd King <hi>Alpatracy,</hi> and his Company, with ſo favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Wind, that all things went according to their Wiſh, and the King was ſo carefully lookt after by his Chyrurgions, that his wounds were wholly Cur'd. But that of the <hi>Knight of the Burning ſword</hi> grew daily worſe and worſe, ſeeing ſo near him (and yet ſo much out of his Command) <hi>Lucella,</hi> whom he moſt affectionately lov'd: and what yet more griev'd him, was, that the Queen never let her be out of her ſight. Thus had they not any means to Confer familiarly with one another, but liv'd in hopes, that Place and Time would one day afford them a better conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency. And in the mean time their ſole Delight was to diſcourſe together, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Affections with Amorous Glanſes, ſhot from their Eyes, which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:154293:45"/> often carry'd News to their paſſionate Hearts, of what they moſt deſir'd.</p>
               <p>In this manner they continu'd their Courte, till one Evening about Sun-ſet, they diſcover'd within a League of them a little Iſland, which ſeem'd to them ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly planted with Trees, and water'd with an Infinity of little Rivers, that the Queen, weary of the Sea, deſir'd the King to Land there, and refreſh them, which was no diſagreeable Requeſt. He therefore caus'd a Boat to be let down into the Sea, into which He and the Queen went, accompany'd only by <hi>Lucelia, Frandamella,</hi> and the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> who took his Arms, as the King alſo did, together with their Steeds, to defend themſelves, if any Adventure ſhould give them occaſion. Then <hi>Frandamella,</hi> who ſerv'd for Pilot, ſet her ſelf to row, for ſhe had heretofore handled the Oar, for Divertiſment. By means whereof ſhe in a moment carry'd them off from the Principal Ship, which the King comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the mean time to ride at Anchor, intending to make a ſpeedy Return.</p>
               <p>They had not Sail'd long, e're driven and maſter'd by the Wind, they came within a Bow ſhot of a very high Rock: high and ſteep I may well call it, for it in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner toucht the Clouds, and was cut either by Nature, or with ſuch Artifice, that it ſeem'd to have paſs'd the Hatcher or Chiſel. On the Top were an Old Woman and an Old Man, holding each other by the Collar, and wreſtling with ſo much Agility, that at every turn the one, or the other, appear'd likely to be thrown. And in fine they mutually tript up each other with ſo great Violence, that they both without let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting go their hold fell into the bottom of the Sea, and immediately alſo the Rock ſank with ſuch an Emotion and Tempeſt, that the Waves ſwell'd up with ſo great a Contrariety of Winds, that the Boat which was guided by <hi>Frandamella,</hi> was above an hundred times tover'd with Water, and ready to be ſwallow'd up, greatly terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and taking from them all hopes of ever getting to Shore, for their guide was ſo aſtoniſht, that abandoning Rudder, Oar, and whatever was ſerviceable to them, ſhe fell down without ſtirring either Hand or Foot.</p>
               <p>This when <hi>Lucella</hi> ſaw, trembling like the leaf of the Tree, ſhe knew no better Place of Security, than the Arms of her Knight, into which, as her laſt Refuge, ſhe caſt her ſelf. Then (tho' the Inclemency of the Weather preſented them with ſo Evident a Danger) this Favor of his Miſtreſs was ſo agreeable to him, that, as one Nail drives out another, he forgot the Peril of Shipwrack; to let her underſtand that, in which his life was through the exceſs of his love, unleſs ſhe took pity of his Perſon. For the obtaining of which he began to make her this Remonſtrance: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I humbly beſeech you to believe, that the Rigor of this Sea cannot be ſo cruel or dreadful to me, as is the Violence of that Flame, which conſumes me, who love you with ſuch an Affection, that none but my ſelf can feel, or comprehend, unleſs he will meaſure it by the Greatneſs and Excellence of your Beauty: And in this caſe every perſon of good Judgment will bear me witneſs, that tho' I ſhould dy an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times a day, yet would not theſe Deaths be ſufficient to merit the leaſt Favour of your good Grace.

               <p>Theſe Remonſtrances were intermixt with Sighs, accompany'd with ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Tears, that the Fore-part of his Armor was all wet with them.

But now there was no Remedy. She muſt (in obedience to the King) riſe, and with the Knights Help go to the other end of the Boat, where the Queen was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly making Vows and Prayers to GOD for their Safety, of which ſhe had little or no Hopes: for the Storm ſo maſter'd their Veſſel, that during all that day they could not ſee either Heaven or Earth, nor diſcern any thing, but an imperuous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and Clouds, driven by Wind, intermix'd with Hail, Thunder, and Lightnings, horrible enough to daunt the moſt reſolute Courages.</p>

And tho' the Countrey was unknown to them, and that they ſaw neither Path, nor Way, to get up; yet they thought themſelves much better amongſt the Shrubs and Briars, than amidſt the Rage and Tempeſt of that mercileſs Sea, where they had been ſo much tormented. Now Neeeſſity, which is, as every one knows, the Miſtreſs of Arts, made them ſearch diligently about, till they found a Path, a little beaten, and frequented.</p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> ſaid to the King; <hi>Sir, I think, it would be beſt, that we ſhould go up, and ſee, if we can diſcover any Houſe, or Cottage, where we may get Shelter.</hi>

But before they could come near it, they ſaw at a good diſtance two great Marble Pillars, where there began a Wall which went to a very fair Tower, and thence to another about a Bow-ſhoot off where were likewiſe two Pillars and ſo to four more, each at a Bow-ſhoot Diſtance from the laſt, before it, and thence to the Caſtle, which compleated the number of ſeven. But they ſaw neither Man, nor Woman, of whom they might enquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Place, which made them certainly believe it to be uninhabited. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs conſidering the Danger out of which they were juſt eſcap't, nothing could preſent it ſelf to their Eyes, which ſeem'd capable to offend them. They went on therefore, till they came to an high erected Pillar of Cryſtal, on the Top of which was a great gilt Statue; repreſenting the Perſon of a Queen, holding in her left hand a Roll, ſo long, that it reacht down to the Baſis of the Pillar, wherein, with excellent artifice were graven certain <hi>Caldean</hi> Characters, to which ſhe pointed with her Right.

               <p>
                  <hi>In good Faith,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>this is a ſtrange Hap. As far as I can ſee, we are then arriv'd in the Iſle of</hi> Argenes, <hi>of which I never heard, as I know of: at worſt we ſhall ſee, what Enchantments and adventures are here.</hi>

                  <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwer'd the Knight, <hi>Night comes on upon us, and I am of Opinion, that we paſs no farther till to morrow, when we will enter the Caſtle if we can.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was very agréeable to the Ladies: wherefore they Alighted, and (unbrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their Horſes, to let them feed,) ſat down at the Foot of the Pillar, where they had not long been, when there came towards them a very Ancient Gentleman, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Faulcon on his Fiſt. He, knowing, that they were Strangers, askt them, what they were doing: <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if you be perceiv'd by thoſe of the Caſtle, you cannot avoid being put into the moſt doleful Priſon, that ever wretched perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>I ſhall willingly do it,</hi> reply'd the Old Man, <hi>for the pity, I have of you.

True it is, that ſhe has left in her place a Daughter of hers, nam'd</hi> Axiana, <hi>the faireſt, I think, in the World, and with her ſeven Knights, eſteem'd amongſt the beſt of Aſia, of which four are Giants, and every one of the ſeven has the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of one of theſe Towers, with expreſs command from the Queen, that no Knight arrive in this Countrey, but that he be kill'd, or taken. Now I am come to acquaint the Guards, that</hi> Axiana <hi>will within two days return from Hunting, where ſhe has been all this laſt week. But doubt not, that I will ſay any thing to them of you: for I would rather divert them from doing you hurt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then bidding them good night, he ſpur'd towards the Caſtle, leaving them in great doubt, and ready to take another way, if they could tell how; but the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> ſtopt them, telling the King, that, ſince there was but one Guard in each Tower, they ought to try their Fortune: <hi>For I hope,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that with the help of our gods we ſhall defeat them, and have the Place at our Command, before</hi> Axiana <hi>returns. And ſhould it not be ſo, you know, Sir, the little means, there is to ſave us, this Countrey being encompaſt with the Sea, and we without Ship or Boat: So that it were much better to dye ſpeedily, than to languiſh longer. One thing there is which exceedingly comforts me, to wit, a firm Belief, that, what ever has hitherto befaln us, is ſome fatal Deſtiny, the Iſſue of which will perhaps be better, and more honourable, than we expected: and therefore I beſeech you not to be troubled, but to recomfort theſe Ladies, whom the ſeeing you ſo perplext has very much diſcontented.</hi>

Whilſt they were diſcourſing thus, they came to a very deep River, over which was a Bridge of Wood, whereby they were to paſs into the firſt Tower. Then they preſently heard an Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n ſound, and perceiv'd a Knight of immenſe Bigneſs come forth, mounted on a marvellous ſtrong Steed, who from the Entrance of the Bridge, call'd out to him <hi>of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> burning Sword,</hi> (for he march'd before the King) ſaying: <hi>Sir Knight, leave your Arms, and come without conſtraint into my Priſon, elſe I will make both you, and your Companion, loſe your Heads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he anſwer'd not a word to all theſe Threats, ſo that running one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, they met with ſo much violence on the Bridge, that their Staves breaking, the Knight of the Tower and his Steed were tumbled into the River, whence the Horſe at laſt got out, leaving his Maſter in the bottom, who never in the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of it. And the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> marching on, the Watch, who had ſounded the Horn, made a great cry and went off.</p>
               <p>Then the King and the Ladies, which accompany'd the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> drew near, and paſs'd the Tower together, at coming out of which they heard another Horn ſound from the next Fortreſs. This they rightly thought to be the calling forth of the Guard to the Combat: wherefore the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> went to meet him: and when they were within a Career of one another, the Knight of the Tower, riding on a great black Horſe, cry'd out as loud as he could: <hi>Yield your ſelf, poor Wretch, and reſolve to ſuffer perpetual impriſonment, and Hunger: for by you has my Companion loſt his Life, as we have underſtood by the cry of the Watch.</hi>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:154293:48"/> thinks to revenge anothers Diſgrace, very often increaſes his own, I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that you ſhould forbear any farther Threats, and think of defending your ſelf againſt me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then they Spur'd one againſt the other, and their meeting was ſuch, that the Guard break his Spear on his Enemies Shield, who, having better taken his Aim, pierc'd him quite thro' the Body, ſo that he fell dead on the Graſs. Which the ſecond Watch ſeeing, made the like Cry with the former, and then diſappear'd, whilſt the King and the Ladies approacht the Tower, which they found ſhut; but the Keys hanging in an Iron Chain by the Gate, they open'd it.</p>
               <p>They were ſcarce entred when the third Watch, ſounding as the two former had done, call'd them forth to meet the next Guard, who was ready for the Combat: Wherefore the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> advancing, ſo coming from far, a great Giant, arm'd in very ſtrong Armor, having two Steel Maces, one upon his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the other at his Saddle-Bow, who, before they met ſpeak thus to the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword: Knight, the Combat between thee and me is (according to the Cuſtom of this Tower) to be perform'd with Maces: wherefore take, which of theſe two thou wilt, and think of doing thy Devoir: nevertheleſs if thou wilt yield to my Will, I ſhall perhaps have mercy on thy Perſon, which is in ſo great Danger.</hi>

But his Condition was much worſe: For his two Eyes were ſtarted out of his Head, and his life wholly gone. Then the King brought the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror his Horſe, and the Ladies drew near, to know, how he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So well,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>that I have no Hurt, to hinder my paſſing on, if nothing worſe befalls me.</hi>

Then of a ſudden there preſented himſelf a Knight of a wonderful Stature, having his Head like to that of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maſtiff, his Armor being a Shirt of Mail, with a great and ſtrong Shield, a Semiter by his Side, a Bow in his Hand, and at his Back a Quiver, hangingfull of Arrows, one of which he held r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:154293:49"/> Inhabitants have the Faces of Dogs, he had thence taken his Name, being call'd <hi>Cynocephal.</hi> Now he came to fight on foot, which made the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> think, he ſhould have enough to do with this new ſort of Arms; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs bowing down his Head, he reſolv'd to expect his Fortune, which was ſuch, that <hi>Cynocephal,</hi> ſeeing him march ſtrait towards him, before his Approach, let fly an Arrow with ſuch ſtrength, that piercing the Horſes Frontal, it entred into his Brain, and kil'd him. Then he took another, wherewith he wounded the Knight in the thigh, which ſo enrag'd him, that feeling nothing at preſent of the Wound, he got haſtily up again, and ran upon his Enemy, being well cover'd with his Shield, in which he receiv'd two Shots more from the Dogs-face, with whom, in fine, he came hand to hand, and their Combat was ſo ſharp and cruel, that the Pieces of their Armor fell thick to the ground. And thus ſtriking on the right hand, and the left, the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> ſorry, and aſham'd at ſo long a Delay of his Victory, eſpecially in the preſence of his Lady and Miſtreſs, ſtept forward, and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Arm, as if he would ſtrike the <hi>Cynocephal</hi> on the Top of his Head, ſeiz'd with his left hand on his Shield, which he pull'd to him with ſo much ſtrength, that plucking it from his Neck, he brought him with his Noſe to the Ground. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he ſuddenly got up again, and thinking to revenge himſelf, let fall his Semiter with all the force, he could, at the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword;</hi> but he ſtepping aſide, avoided the Blow, and as he turn'd, gave the Dogs-face ſuch a Thruſt in his Throat, as cut his Wind-pipe: At which the Watch of the fifth Tower won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, wound his Horn, and crying out with a piteous voice; diſappear'd, whilſt the King and the Ladies advanc'd, doubting their Knight to be more wounded, then he was.</p>
               <p>To remedy which, <hi>Frandamella</hi> inſtantly alighted and bound up his wound with a clean Linen Cloth. The Blood was no ſooner ſtopt, but the Guard of the fifth Tower preſented himſelf, no leſs furious than the reſt, for beſides that he was a Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of a very fierce Counteance, he would have the Combat to be with Axes, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that purpoſe two upon his Shoulders, of which he gave the choiſe to the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> who, in fine, diſcomfited him, and the Sentinel ſounded after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as the former had done.</p>
               <p>The fifth Tower being then conquer'd, and the King with his Train having paſs'd there came forth of the ſixth a young Knight, about thirty years old, having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arms, but a ſword and a Cloak, with which he hop'd to defend, what he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to. Then he marcht towards him, who had already Conquer'd ſo much, and at his approach began to ſay to him: <hi>Certainly, Sir Knight, you ought in reaſon to be much eſteem'd having defeated five ſuch, that it is difficult to find their Equals: And to ſhew the Truth of it, it is not within the Memory of Man, that ever any, beſides yourſelf, got by force to the third Tower: but ſince Fortune has been ſo favourable to you, and you are, as I ſee, reſolv'd to follow it, you muſt obſerve the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons requir'd in this place, which are ſuch. The Combat between us two is to be with Sword and Cloak, without any other Arms whatever: Therefore
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:154293:49"/> you may well eaſe your ſelf of all this Armor, which is, I believe, very burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> was excellently well skil'd in fencing, and for this cauſe not willing to refuſe the others Offer, made him this Anſwer: <hi>In good faith I am diſpleas'd at the Death of your Companions, tho' you cannot but know, that it was not ſo much thro' my Fault, as their own, and the perverſe Cuſtom of this Place, for which I am ſorry, that if you think ſit to leave it at preſent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſtraining me any farther to fight, aſſure your ſelf, you will lay an Obligation on me for ever. For, beſides that you ſeem to me a valiant man, you have in the beginning ſo prais'd me, that I know not, what Thanks to give you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Truly,</hi> ſaid the other, <hi>were I Maſter of my ſelf, our Accord would be eaſily made: but I have given my Faith to her, that brought me into theſe Coaſts, to defend the Tower to my death. And <hi>I</hi> was indeed much ſurpriz'd, when I oblig'd my ſelf to it: For ſhe askt me a Gift, which I granted her, without knowing what, whereof I have had leiſure enough to repent me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Since it is ſo,</hi> anſwer'd the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword, I would not for any thing deſire ought of you, that may blemiſh your Honor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he call'd <hi>Frandamella</hi> to help him off with his Harneſs, of which, when he was deveſted, the Knight of the Caſtle, ſeeing him ſo fair, and well-proportion'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a very great Eſteem for him.

               <p>Scarce had he utter'd this word, when the Damſel retir'd: for the Knight of the Caſtle would proceed to the Combat which was between them the moſt gallant that ever was ſeen.

               <p>Thus the King and the Knight entred into the Tower, into which they had ſeen the Ladies carry'd, whom they found not there: and for this cauſe the went towards the ſeventh, near which they met the four Villains, returning from their Enterprize, to aſſiſt thoſe, that were aſſaulted, but whatever Reſiſtance they could make, the two principal of them were ſlain on the Place, and the others taken to Mercy, on Promiſe of declaring, what they had done with the Queen and her Company. Now as they were going into the Caſtle, the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> ſeeing that the laſt Guard did not appear, as the other had done, enquir'd of the Villains, where he was.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> went up to the Chamber of Treaſure, where the <hi>Emperor</hi> of <hi>Trebiſond, L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſvart</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaul</hi> were Enchanted: And what befel them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> having two ſeveral Wounds, one in his Leg, made by <hi>Cynocephals</hi> Arrow, the other in his Heart, by <hi>Lucella's</hi> Beauty, could not take any reſt for the Light of the Tapers that were burning in the Chamber: But aſſoon as they were extinct, thinking by the Help of the Darkneſs to cloſe his Eyes, there came ſuch a Brightneſs from the Stair-caſe, we lately mention'd, as made him ſuddenly ſtart up: And doubting ſome Treaſon, he haſtily took his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and his Shield, and with his Sword in hand going ſtrait to the Place, whence this great Light proceeded, he began to aſcend the Steps towards the <hi>Chamber of Treaſure,</hi> till he came under a Perron, ſupported by ſeven Pillars of Iarinth, ſo tranſparent and ſhining, that he eaſily perceiv'd in each of them an Image of Gold, ſo curiouſly wrought, that they wanted nothing but Life.</p>
               <p>Two of theſe repreſented the Effigies of Men, and all the Reſt of Women: Whoſe Robes were ſo cover'd with Diamonds, and other precious ſtones, that from the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of them iſſu'd ſuch a Light, as twenty Torches could not have yielded a greater. Now each ſtatue had in its left hand a Roll of Gold with Latin Letters, and with the Right pointed to the Walls, towards which their Faces were turn'd, whereon were painted with marvelous Artifice certain Hiſtories, which I am going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe to you.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſtatue, repreſenting a Man, had on his Head an Imperial Crown, and in his Roll were written theſe Words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apolidon, <hi>Emperor of</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>the moſt excellent of all Magicians, that ever were.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Hiſtories, he pointed to with with his right hand, were the Proof of the Ark of loyal Lovers, and the Defended Chamber, where <hi>Amadis</hi> and <hi>Oriana</hi> acquir'd greater Fame than all others, that attemted to enter. The Trial of the Sword and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, with the Kerchief, cover'd with Flowers, which this excellent King and Queen gain'd, as you find it diſcrib'd in the ſecond Book of <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaul.</hi> Hard by was pictur'd, how <hi>Liſvart</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> pluckt the Sword out of the Lyons Body before the Well Gate of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> at ſuch time as it was beſieg'd by <hi>Armato,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Firm Iſland</hi> were diſenchanted.</p>
               <p>The next Statue was of a very ancient man, in whoſe Roll were the following Words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alquif, <hi>the great Philoſopher, more intelligent inſupernatural things, then any man in his time.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:154293:51"/>
               <p>The Hiſtories, he ſhew'd painted on the oppoſite Wall; were the Ship, govern'd by Apes, when he ſent to fetch the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and thoſe, whom <hi>Urgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> had ſtay'd in the Palace of <hi>Apolidon</hi> by Force of her Conjurations: the manner, how he arriv'd at <hi>Fenuſa,</hi> where <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaul,</hi> and <hi>Liſvart</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> (ſurnam'd, the one the <hi>German,</hi> and the other the <hi>Solitary Knight</hi>) juſted againſt all Comers, and were by him diſcover'd, after they had a long time conceal'd themſelves.</p>
               <p>Next to this on another Pillor, was the Image of a Queen, holding her Roll, on which was w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Medea, <hi>expert and skilful above all others in the Secrets of Nature.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Painting over againſt her repreſented King <hi>Alpatracy</hi> and his Wife enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with the Helmet and Crown, gotten by <hi>Liſvart</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Onoloria,</hi> as is recorded in the ſixth Book of <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Statue was of a Woman, whoſe Roll had theſe Words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am the <hi>Damſel Enchantreſs,</hi> who was ſecond to none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The oppoſite Painting ſhew'd, how the Emperor <hi>Eſplandian</hi> got the Sword, the Treaſure, the Image of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the Lion, with the Tombs, as it is at large in the fifth Book of the ſaid Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>The next Image ſhew'd an honourable Old Woman, wearing a Crown, in whoſe Role was this Line:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Princeſs <hi>Melia,</hi> the moſt exquiſite Sorcereſs in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Wall was painted with the Hiſtory of the Adventurous Fountain, where <hi>Eſplandian</hi> found the Infanta <hi>Eliaxa;</hi> the manner, how the ſaid <hi>Melia</hi> was, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with King <hi>Armato,</hi> brought Priſoner into <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> how the Dragons carry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The next Statue was alſo of an Ancient Woman, cloath'd like a Matron of that time and in the Writing, ſhe held, were theſe Words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Organda <hi>the moſt wiſe Enchantreſs.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>She directed to the Hiſtory of the Enchantment, made by her in the Caſtle of <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidon</hi> over the Kings <hi>Amadis, Galaor, Agraies,</hi> and other Princes, Lords, Ladies, and Gentlewomen, as you find it amply related in the fourth Book of the ſaid Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The Ship alſo of the Serpent, with the Frights, ſhe many times caus'd by her Arrival at the Port of <hi>Fenuſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeventh and laſt Statue repreſented the Effigies of a Queen, holding ſo long a Roll, that it environ'd the whole Circumference of the <hi>Perron,</hi> having theſe words engraven in it;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zirfea, <hi>Queen of</hi> Argenes, <hi>Magician, a Lover of Knowledge, and of the Knowing in the Art, wherein I have been inſtructed, by which (to perpetuate my Memory) I have built this</hi> Perron, <hi>and what it contains, eſpecially to put Poſterity in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by the ſtrange Facts of thoſe, that are here repreſented, who have neither before, nor ſince, had their Equals.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:154293:52"/>
               <p>With her other hand ſhe pointed to the Entrance of a Stair-caſe, the ſteps where of were of white Saphire, the Perron being all cover'd with Vine-work, the Leaves of which were of Gold, and the Grapes of Rubies, Diamonds, and Emeralds, with an infinite Number of ſmall Birds, and little Creatures, ſo curiouſly wrought, that they ſeem'd to have been forg'd by Nature her ſelf.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> took ſo much Pleaſure in this place, that the longer he lookt, the leſs weary he was of looking, contemplating the Hiſtorys, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about the Perron, moſt of which he had often heard recounted in the Court of King <hi>Magaden.</hi> And as he was turning thus from one ſide to another, he eſpy'd a great Lyon, ſleeping cloſe by the latter Stair-caſe, up which he went, and having A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended the firſt four or five ſteps, he perceiv'd a Portico, under which was a Door ſhut, and all of a flaming Fire; nevertheleſs there was a Damſel leaning againſt it, who ſeem'd to him of a Stature, above the common Proportion of others, but otherwiſe very fair, tho' her Countenance ſeem'd full of Diſcontent, and deep Melancholly, for ſhe held her Head leaning upon her left hand, and in her right hand a naked Sword, from the Pommel of which proceeded a Brightneſs, like to that of the Planet <hi>Mars,</hi> when he is in his greateſt Vigor. And altho' ſhe had her Eyes ſhut, like one in a ſlumber, yet did the Tears trickle down her Face, and ſhe ever and anon fetch'd ſuch deep ſighs, as ſtruck the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> with ſo great wonder and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, that addreſſing himſelf to her, he ſaid: <hi>Damſel, I beſeech you, conceal not from me the Cauſe of your ſorrow: for I aſſure you if I can remedy it, you ſhall find me ready to ſerve you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this word ſhe open'd her Eyes, and ſeeing him ſo near her, rous'd up her ſelf, as one throughly frighted, anſwer'd him with great wrath: <hi>Ah! raſh and premſuptuous wretch! haſt thou then dar'd to attempt the Coming up hither? Thou ſhalt indeed preſently receive thy Reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſtretching out her Arm, ſhe gave him ſuch a Blow with the Sword, as pierc't his Shield, Armor, and Body, to the very Hilt, the Knight falling all along on the Place. But then, as if ſhe were come to her ſelf out of a deep Sleep, ſhe preſently cry'd out: <hi>O</hi> Iupitor! <hi>Alas what have I done? I have cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Then ſitting on his knees, ſhe took the Knights Head in her Lap, and having fixt her Eye on it, her Sorrow grew ſo ſtrong, as if Heart would have cleft aſunder: And in this Paſſion ſhe fell down in a ſwound upon the wounded Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucella</hi> was not then aſleep, but ſollicited by the Love, ſhe bare her Friend, had him continually before the Eyes of her Imagination, and heard the Damſel's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets and Cries: Wherefore not knowing, what to think of it, ſhe look't ſtrait to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Place, where ſhe had ſeen him ly down, but he was no longer there: at which, ſurpriz'd with an unuſual Iealouſy, ſhe roſe up, and ran haſtily towards the ſtair-ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, whence, in her opinion, the Lamentations proceeded, which gave her this Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. She went up to the Perron, where ſhe again heard a Voice, ſaying pitifully: <hi>Ah, ah, poor, miſerable, and unfortunate</hi> Gradafilea! <hi>What will become of thee,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:154293:52"/> having with thine own hands ſlain the Perſon, thou moſt lovedſt in the world, and whom thou haſt taken ſo much pains to find? O thou moſt unhappy of thoſe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that live baniſht from all Felicity, how is it poſſible, that ſeeing, with thine own Eyes, the Death of him, caus'd by thine own Act, who was more dear to thee, than thy ſelf, thou ſhouldſt any longer continue in this World, out of which thou haſt driven him! Ah Queen of</hi> Argenes! <hi>thou greatly deceivdſt me, when, at my entrance into this place of Tribulation, thou aſſuredſt me, that at the time, my Hope ſhould be wholly loſt, my heart ſhould have Repoſe, ſeeing him, whom I deſir'd to find. But (alas!) this promiſe of thine is quite overthrown, and I cannot well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, what diſpleaſure I have ever done thee, that thou ſhouldſt purchaſe me ſo into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable a Diſcontent! One Remedy there is, which thou cannot deprive me of, which is, the death that I will give my ſelf, to follow, and bear him company, in ſo ſevere cruelty, as has parted from theſe hands, ſtain'd with the blood of my Friend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Lucella</hi> had ſome time hearkned to her, and perceiv'd, ſhe ſpake of the death of a Friend, her Blood was in ſuch a Commotion, that ſhe could no longer bear, what ſhe thought, ſo that ſhe went up to her, who was endeavouring to pluck out the Sword for to murther her ſelf: Where ſeeing the Knight ſtret'ht out at his length, ſhe caſt forth ſo loud a Cry, that the Lion, who was aſleep, awak't, and fell a roaring in the moſt dreadful manner, that ever was heard, ſo that <hi>Lucella,</hi> with the Fright, was fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, when the Beaſt caught hold of her Gown, by which, with his Sharp claws, he ſo violently pluckt her to him, that ſhe was ready to fall down backwards. The poor Lady was then in certain expectation of death; nevertheleſs, whether thro' Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, or thro' exceſs of Fear, ſhe had recourſe to the Sword, that ſhe ſaw in the Body of her Lover, which ſhe ſo ſtrongly pull'd at, that ſhe got it out of his Body, not without great Myſtery: for the burning Door inſtantly flow open with ſuch impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, that the Inhabitants, ten Leagues round, aſſuredly believ'd the Ruine of the Place, and of the whole Iſland. And the Flame ſo evidently paſs'd thro' the Halls and Stair-caſes, that the King and Queen, who were aſleep, awake, but not without being frighted: Becauſe this Brightneſs paſs'd away like a Shadow, leaving the Place ſo dark, and full of Smoak, that for above a quarter of an hour, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be diſcern'd, but Obſcurity and Blackneſs: During which, the Knight, whom <hi>Gradaſilea</hi> and <hi>Lucella</hi> thought dead, roſe up well and luſty, and yet more amaz'd to ſee them both ſtretcht out on the Grownd, not ſtirring either Foot or Hand. Now take my word for't, he paid. Vſe for the Diſpleaſure, his Miſtreſs had receiv'd: For ſeeing her in ſuch Condition, he was ready to deſpair, and make himſelf away, when taking her in his Arms, to give her a Farewel kiſs, no ſooner were their two Mouths joyn'd together, but that her vital Spirits return'd to their Natural Head, ſo that coming again to her ſelf, and knowing him to be alive, whom ſhe eſteem'd, as bead, ſhe ſaid to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ah, ah! my dear Friend! Do I dream, or did I not juſt now ſee you wounded thro' the Body? I take GOD to witneſs, that I verily thought your Life at an end.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>During theſe Careſſes, the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> could not imagin, whence they proceeded, having never ſeen <hi>Gradafilea:</hi> nevertheleſs he thought, that perhaps ſhe knew his Father and Mother, and that his name was <hi>Liſvart,</hi> as ſhe call'd him. But <hi>Lucella,</hi> who found her ſelf concern'd, was not ſo ſatisfy'd, perſwading her ſelf, that ſhe alone, and none elſe, ought to have ſhare in her Lover, who, loving <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dafilea,</hi> had thus conceal'd himſelf from her. And to ſay the truth, the precedent Lamentations and Regrets, gave her a great Miſtruſt, which was much augmented, when ſhe ſaw him let himſelf be embrac'd, without contradicting it, tho' his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion tended to another end, being only deſirous to know of <hi>Gradafilea,</hi> where ſhe had ſeen him, to know him ſo, as ſhe made a ſhew of; and for this reaſon he ſaid to her: <hi>In good faith, Madam, I believe, that you take me for another: for I never in my life, had any Acquaintance with you, as I know of.</hi>
               </p>

And you tell me, that you never had any Acquaintance with me! Certainly, if you call to mind</hi> Gradafilea, <hi>Daughter to the King of the</hi> Giants Iſland, <hi>you will ſoon change your Opinion: for I am ſhe, and no other, who have for your ſake remain'd thirteen years in this Place, enchanted, as you found me, with as much Bitterneſs, and Grief, as ever any ſorrowful, and wretched Woman ſuffer'd. Nevertheleſs, all this Affliction is ſo well overcome, that I am at preſent the moſt Joyful, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented on the Earth.</hi>

                  <hi>In good faith,</hi> ſaid the Knight, <hi>you may put me in mind of what you pleaſe, but I as little know the Emperor and the Empreſs, you ſpeak on, as I do you: Nor can I tell, who are my Father and Mother, which is indeed, the greateſt Trouble, and Diſpleaſure, I could have in this World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gradafilea</hi> than more attentively view'd him, than ſhe had hitherto done, and as well by the Brightneſs of the Swords Pommel, lying on the Floor, as by the light

               <p>At this very Inſtant came the King, accompany'd by the Queen, and <hi>Frandamel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> wondring to ſee the Knight between <hi>Gradafilea</hi> and his Daughter. And as he was opening his mouth, to ask them, how they came there together, he ſaw the Sword at his Feet, which he knew by its ſhining Pommel, and taking it up of a ſuddain, ſaid: <hi>By my Head, this is not the firſt time, I have handled thee, and I know, that thou belongedſt to the beſt Knight in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ah Sir, and who was he?</hi> ſaid the Knight.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Then he advanc'd towards the Burning Door, which was immediately chang'd into Chryſtal, and they all entred without any danger into the <hi>Chamber of Treaſure,</hi> where there befel a Caſe worthy Recital.</p>
               <p>There appear'd in the Air two Hands, holding a golden Crown, enricht with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Rubies, Pearls, and Diamonds, which they plac'd upon the Head of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cella,</hi> and then diſappear'd at the ſound of a voice, which cry'd out: <hi>Receive, fair Lady, this Reward, in teſtimony of having put an End to the ſtrangeſt Adventure, that ever was, or ſhall be prepar'd for Lady, or Gentlewoman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being ſaid four tall Statues of Alabaſter, which in the four Corners of the Chamber repreſented four Ladies, holding each of them an Harp, began to play ſo melodious a Tune, that the King and the reſt thought, they heard the Ioys of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe: and indeed to conſider the Place well, there ſeem'd alſo to be in it ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity. For the Walls were of pure Chryſtal, under which appear'd, painted in Gold and Azure, many Hiſtories of the glorious Feats of Arms, perform'd by ſeveral Illuſtrious Perſonages, which had been from the Time of <hi>Deucalion</hi> till then. The Cieling and the Floor, being all of Moſaick Work, wrought in Chryſolite and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry, rendred the Place ſo admirable, that it might be properly ſaid to have been the Worſt, not of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> or <hi>Neptune,</hi> who built the Walls of <hi>Flium;</hi> but of <hi>Pallas,</hi> who had employ'd in it all her Induſtry. In the midſt of this Room was alſo a Monument of Iacinth, to which there was on every ſide an Aſcent of five ſteps of gray Marble, and upon it the Repreſentation of a great King, compleatly Arm'd, except his Head, which was cleft in two with a blow of a Sword: This reſted on a Pillow of Cloth of Gold, which a Knight held between his Arms, the King having in one hand a little Key of Emerald, and in the other a Padlock, made of a great Carbuncle, which lockt up the Sepulchre, environ'd with Seven and Thirty Kings of Maſſy Gold, behind whom a little higher ſtood twelve Nymphs of Azure ſtone, holding Silver Trumpets, as if they were ready ſo Sound. And that it might be better known, whoſe Body it was, that lay in this Magnificence, there was at his Feet a Tablet of Agat, on which in the <hi>Caldean</hi> Tongue, was graven the following Inſcription.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:154293:54"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is the Repreſentation of <hi>Zarzafiel,</hi> Soldan of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who, being at the Siege of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with King <hi>Armato,</hi> was ſlain with the blow of a Sword by the hand of King <hi>Amadis,</hi> as is ſeen by his Figure: And the Kings, that are about him, being in number ſeven and thirty, repreſent ſo many Princes, ſubject to them, who all dyed in his Company, fighting like valiant and hardy men, as they were. Now to perpetuate his Memory, his Siſter <hi>Zirfea,</hi> Queen of <hi>Argenes,</hi> has caus'd the Aſhes of his Body to be put in a Veſſel or Gold, here underneath, giving by the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of his Burial a Teſtimony of the Affection, ſhe bear him, when living: and yet the more to honour him in his death, has given him in keeping the Key of this unparallell'd Treaſure, which ſhall be well defended, till ſuch time as the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect accompliſht Knight in the World ſhall enter in here, accompany'd by the faireſt Lady, then living: who by Vertue of the ſecret Love, they ſhall bear one another, ſhall ſeize on the Key, and open the Padlock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In good faith,</hi> ſaid the King to the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword, this Propheſy is, I think, addreſt to you, and none elſe.</hi>

But ſhe excus'd her ſelf, affectionately deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Gradafilea</hi> to make the firſt Proof, and ſhe would afterwards ſecond her, if it were neceſſary. Now <hi>Gradafilea</hi> was exquifitly fair, which made her aſſuredly think, that, if the Adventure was to be ended by Beauty, ſhe ſhould go a great way in it. For this cauſe ſhe readily conſented to <hi>Lucellas</hi> deſire, ſo that approaching the Statue, which held they Key, ſhe did her utmoſt to ſeize it, and take it from him: but ſo far was ſhe from it, that ſhe could not ſo much as ſtir it, which made her bluſh, and retire, to give Place to <hi>Lucella:</hi> to whom, as ſhe advanc'd, the Statue ſtretcht out his Arm, and preſented her, what ſhe deſir'd, at which the <hi>Knight of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Sword</hi> greatly rejoyc'd, more eſteeming the Honour of his Lady, that if himſelf had obtain'd all the Glory in the World.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Lucella</hi> opened the Padlock, with which the Tomb was clos'd, and took off the covering as eaſily, as if it had been of Cork, or Fir: and immed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For this only cauſe were the four Knights preſerv'd, and put into her Bark, where ſhe was afterwards enamor'd of <hi>Olorius,</hi> with whom ſhe had ſuch Converſe, that her Belly began to ſwell, ſhe being with chield; yet being no more willing to pardon him, than the reſt, being arriv'd in her Iſle of <hi>Argenes,</hi> ſhe enchanted them, and put them all under the Soldans Tomb, unknown to any one, even to their own ſelves: Then ſhe conjur'd the Chambers, and clos'd the Doors by the Fire which continually burnt there</p>
               <p>Now it hapned ſome time after, that <hi>Gradafilea,</hi> underſtanding the loſs of <hi>Liſvart,</hi> put her ſelf in queſt of him: And having travers'd many ſtrange Countries, without learning any Fews of him, ſhe come at laſt to <hi>Zirfea,</hi> to whom ſhe entirly declar'd the Occaſion of her Travel, very earneſtly beſeeching her, that ſhe would pleaſe to deliver her out of his Pain.</p>

               <p>And to make the Entrance into the Place yet more ſtrange, and difficult, ſhe built a little lower the Perron, where were the ſeven ſtatues, holding their writings and other Singularities. Then ſhe found the means, to procure five Knights of excellent

               <p>
                  <hi>O Soveraign GOD! who by your infinite goodneſs have created all things of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and who at no time forget thoſe, that are yours, not having regard to the Merits of their Works; but extending over them your ineffable Bounty and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and that principally, to the end, We, poor Sinners, may know the great
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:154293:56"/> Power of your Divine Majeſty: How can we ever give you thanks for ſo great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as you have ſhewn us, unleſs you, O Lord, enable us to do it? O Emperor of</hi> Trebiſond, <hi>thou oughtſt certainly to eſteem the long Abode, thou haſt made in this place, well employ'd, and no way to complain of Fortune, ſince ſhe has given thee ſuch noble Company.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then embracing now <hi>Liſvart,</hi> anon <hi>Perion,</hi> and now again <hi>Olorius,</hi> he ſaid to them: <hi>Ah! my dear Friends. The love, you have hitherto born me, is at preſent well manifeſted: ſince you have not in this miſerable Priſon ever abandon'd me. Aſſure your ſelves, that, as long as my Soul ſhall remain in this old Body, I ſhall hold my ſelf greatly oblig'd, and indebted to you.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Liſvart, I know not who laid us in ſo ſound aſleep: but on my Faith, I no more remember the time, we have been here, than if it had never been: and we muſt ſay, that ſhe, who took us in</hi> Trebiſond, <hi>deſir'd to make us take along Repoſe, thinking (I believe) that we were yet weary and toil'd with the paſt Wars. But he it as it may, let us, if you pleaſe, go thank theſe Knights for our liberty.</hi>

               <p>Then he caſt his Eye upon <hi>Lucella,</hi> whoſe Beauty caus'd in him a Remembrance of the Princeſs <hi>Onoloria,</hi> ſo that his Heart began to beat, when preſently he knew <hi>Gradafilea:</hi> but not the King or Queen at the firſt ſight.

               <p>But <hi>Gradafilea,</hi> whom Love in that reſpect commanded more than any of the reſt, being aſſur'd by the Emperors Diſcourſe, that <hi>Liſvart,</hi> whom ſhe had ſo long ſought and expected, was indeed there, came to him, and caſting her ſelf at his Feet, ſaid: <hi>Ah! my only Lord and Friend, if you were thro' my means ſometime in Priſon, I have ſince over paid the uſe of it, having endur'd the moſt ſtrange and unhappy life, that ever poor Gentlewoman ſuffer'd, even to this very day, when by the means of this fair Princeſs I ſee the thing, I moſt deſire in the world, which is your Perſon, ſo much regretted by great and little, and which being ſo accompliſht in all Vertue, you will, I hope, have compaſſion of me, and no more fail me, than I did you, when you had moſt need of my aſſiſtance.</hi>

               <p>Whilſt they were in theſe Terms, the Emperor and the reſt took Acquaintance of one another: and the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> ſaid to the Emperor: <hi>Sir, altho'

                  <hi>In good faith, Knight,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>ſeeing the Beauty and Goodneſs, that is in you, and the Offers, you make me, I cannot chooſe but be ſorry, that you are not a</hi> Chriſtian <hi>for the ſalvation of your ſoul: we being all ſo much bound to you, that we ought in reaſon to love and honour you for ever.</hi>

               <p>Whilſt he was making this Harangue, <hi>Liſvart</hi> view'd him, as one, whom Nature would have taught him to know: for the Father was ſpeaking to the Son, and the Son to the Father; and yet both the one and the other was Ignorant of this Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </p>
               <p>Then he threw down a Glove, he had in his hand, and the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> ſtept forward to take it up. But King <hi>Alpatracy</hi> caught him hold by the Arm, ſaying to him: <hi>My dear Friend, I beſeech you, that, in this time of Pleaſure, there be no mention of any thing, which may cauſe our Diſcontent!

               <p>Then they both, without ſhewing any Alteration obey'd the Kings Pleaſure, not without good hopes, when Conveniency ſhould ſerve, to let each other know by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the Proweſs, that was in them, turning themſelves at that time to other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and to behold the Singularities of the Chamber, out of which at laſt they went. And they were no ſooner forth, but the Doors ſhut of themſelves, not being open'd of a long time, but ſo Tranſparent indeed, and Diaphanous, that whatever was within, might be ſeen thro' them. Thence they went down to the Perron, which, when they had view'd, and read the Inſcriptions that were there, <hi>Alpatracy,</hi> who had yet <hi>Liſvarts</hi> Sword, preſented it to him, who was not a little glad of it? for he thought it had been loſt. The King then told him, how he found it, and before their Departure thence, they all related what had befaln them, even to <hi>Lucella</hi> her ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In good faith,</hi> ſaid <hi>Liſvart</hi> then to the King, <hi>if I have heretofore done you any ſervice, in delivering you from the Conjurations of</hi> Medea, <hi>my Lady your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has ſo well recompenſed me, that I ſhall be her Servant as long as I live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſo long did they amuſe themſelves in comtemplating the Particularities of the Place, that the Dawning of the Day began to appear: wherefore they went down into the Chamber, in which the King had ſlept, where they found ſome of the Caſtle, whom the Fright had awaked, when the forementioned Images ſounded their Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets: amongſt which a Servant ſtepping forward, told the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> that <hi>Gradamart,</hi> he, whom he had fought with at the laſt Tower, deſir'd to ſee him before he dy'd: <hi>For,</hi> ſaid the Servant, <hi>he is very weak, by reaſon of the blood; he loſt laſt night, and has ſo great an eſteem for you, that he will think his ſoul much at eaſe, if you do him the favour to viſit him.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Gradafilea,</hi> hearing the Name of <hi>Gradamart,</hi> and doubting as the Truth was, that it was her Brother, of whom the Meſſenger ſpeak, cry'd out pituouſly: <hi>O</hi> Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! <hi>what can this be!

                  <hi>Alas!</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I well know that Fortune is not yet weary of tormenting me. Alas! it is then mine own Brother, who, as you ſay, lies a dying. For Gods ſake, Friend, conduct me where he is, and perhaps his Death and mine will without delay accompany each other.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Then went they all to him, whom they found lying on a Bed, having a great many Wounds, but all ſmall ones, except that in his Leg, which could not be ſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

How oft have you been deſired by me! In Truth, my Heart, which was ready to dye, feels it ſelf in a manner reviv'd, ſeeing you ſo near your Brother, who ſo dearly loves you. O immortal gods! your great Names be prais'd: for it has pleas'd you to permit me, before I leave the World, this day to embrace her, whom (if I dye) I more regret, than mine Life.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Gradafilea,</hi> hearing her Brother ſtill ſpeak with ſo much ſtrength, took heart again, and having recover'd her Speech, made him this Anſwer: <hi>My deareſt Brother, your Life and Death are at their Diſpoſal: but if they have ordain'd the Removal of you out of this World, I deſire you, before I ſee your Eyes clos'd, to put an end to my days with your Hands, that our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits may accompany each other before them, and never be ſeparated, whether in Hell, or in the</hi> Elyſian <hi>Fields, as it ſhall pleaſe them to ordain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſhe renew'd her Lamentations, that <hi>Liſvart,</hi> mov'd with Compaſſion, took her back from <hi>Gradamart,</hi> whom her Grieving exceedingly diſturb'd, and ſo comforted her, that ſeeing her ſelf entertain'd by the Perſon, whom ſhe moſt lov'd in the World, ſhe appeas'd her Sorrow.</p>

               <p>Having ſaid this, he drew his Sword out of the Scabbard, and ſetting his Knee to the Ground, preſented it to him. But <hi>Gradamart,</hi> who was not able to riſe, that he might return this Honour, join'd his Hands, and ſtretching out his Arms, ſaid to him: <hi>For God's ſake, Knight, never do me this injury, after having ſo much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd me, but honouring me, as you have begun, let us, if you pleaſe, embrace, and let our Friendſhip be henceforth irrevocable.</hi>

When therefore the Goaler made them aſcend by a Ladder, he let down to them, they thinking, that they were going to receive their laſt Puniſhment, fervently deſir'd him to tell them, in what manner they were to end their dayes: <hi>Since it cannot</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>be ſo cruel, as not to be more agreeable to us, than this long and hard Priſon.</hi>

               <p>He then guided them to <hi>Gradamarts</hi> Chamber, into which ſix of them entred firſt, dragging along their great Iron Chains.

               <p>NEws then being brought, that the Infanta <hi>Axiana</hi> drew near her Caſtle, the Emperor with the other Knights entred into Conſultation, what was beſt to be done. Some were of Opinion, to run upon her, and ſurprize her with her Company. But <hi>Perion</hi> of <hi>Gaul,</hi> one of the moſt courteous and gentle Princes, then living, advis'd the contrary, ſaying, it would be better to ſend one of them, who might acquaint her, with what was befaln the Guards of her Fortreſs; but that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, if ſhe pleas'd to lodge there, ſhe ſhould be receiv'd with all the Honor and Reverence, her Greatneſs and Beauty merited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he <hi>I ſhall always commend the treating an Enemy with reſpect, principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when he is in greateſt Adverſity, leting every one underſtand, that honour is inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from a Noble and generous Heart, ſhewing it ſelf no leſs in the depth of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune and Infelicity, than in the height of Proſperity and Happineſs: So that, tho' Fortune may often enough bring to nothing earthly Goods, which are ſubject
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:154293:59"/> to her Inconſtancy; yet has ſhe no Power over the Merit and Vertues of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which reſide in the Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Reſolution every one agreed, and as they were conſidering, who was fitteſt to carry the Meſſage to <hi>Axiana,</hi> the King of <hi>Sicily</hi> remonſtrated to them, that none could be more proper, than <hi>Frandamella: For,</hi> ſaid he, Axiana <hi>receiving this diſpeaſing News by a Woman, the Fury, which may ſurprize her, cannot bring a long with it ſuch ſpeedy Vengeance, as it might againſt one of us; but will be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated, ſeeing with whom it ſhall have to do: So that all will go the better.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this reaſon was the Damſel ſent, who, being amply inſtructed for her Ambaſſy, and having an Eſquire to guide her, ſet forth on her way towards the Infanta, that was come to dine in an Houſe of Pleaſure ſhe had, ſituated by the Sea-ſide. But <hi>Frandamella</hi> was ſoon perceiv'd to turn back in great haſt, and aſcend the Caſtle ſtairs, till ſhe came into the Chamber, where all the Knights were ſtill diſcourſing together, whom ſhe thus beſpake: <hi>My Lords, if you pleaſe to ſee the Combat of one Knight againſt ſix, come to the firſt Tower, where I have left them, and you ſhall there have that Diverſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Liſvart Perion,</hi> and <hi>Olorious,</hi> hearing the News, ran thither armed, as they were; as did alſo the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword;</hi> and being arriv'd, where <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damella</hi> had directed them, found the ſix fiercely aſſaulting him, that was alone, who was a comely and couragious Knight, mounted on a ſturdy ſteed, and ſo valiantly behav'd himſelf, that he had already wounded the other in ſeveral places. Now he was arm'd in black Armor, without any Deviſe, ſave that on his Shield there was in a Field <hi>Or</hi> a Caſtle <hi>Gules,</hi> and he ſo beſtirr'd himſelf, that they, who beheld him, could not ſay otherwiſe of him, but that he was a gallant man: for he had in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſlain out-right two of the ſtouteſt; yet the four that were left, displeas'd at this loſs, ſpar'd him ſo little, that it was to be wondred, how he was able to reſiſt them. He nevertheleſs ſhew'd them ſuch play, ſtriking on the right hand, and the left, ſo thick and home, that he ſoon diſpatch't likewiſe the third. Wherefore their Companions, growing more Outragious, fell in upon him, and by ſtrength of Arm threw him (whether he would or no) out of his Saddle upon the Graſs: but he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried two of them along with him, holding them ſo cloſely embrac't, that they could no way offend him: which greatly amaz'd the Beholders. The laſt ſeeing this, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily ſet foot to ground, thinking to relieve his Companions, and murther the other, which he had queſtionleſs done, had he not been hindred by thoſe, that were looking on, who call'd out to him to Retire, or they would certainly fall upon him.</p>
               <p>The Gallant, much aſtoniſht at this Menace, and doubting worſe, ſuddainly took Horſe again, returning with full ſpeed the way he came. In the mean time, thoſe that were thus linkt together, ſo long ſtrove and ſtruggled, ſometimes upper, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under, that they were forc'd for want of Breath to let go their Hold, and get up again, yet not ceaſing their Fight, which they began again with their Swords, as if they had done nothing all the day. Whence it came to paſs, that after many
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:154293:60"/> Charges, given and receiv'd, the Aſſailants had the worſe, being brought to that Condition by the ſingle Knight, that they now did no more but ward his blows.</p>

                  <p>How the Knight, which fled, return'd to his Companions, bringing with him <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencio,</hi> who fought againſt the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THe two Knights being thus handled, and as it were ready to lay down their Arms, he, that had fled, was ſeen to return, accomyany'd by another, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on a great black Horſe, and clad in Green, Armor, powdred all over with Quivers and Arrows of Gold, and bearing in his Shield a Ladies hand, holding a Bow, with an Arrow ready fixt. He was no ſooner come thither, but he Alighted, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his Shield, drew his Sword out of the Scabbard, which was all over cover'd with Pearls, Rubies, and Diamonds: But the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, he would fall upon him in the black Armor, (whom he judg'd within himſelf to be one of the braveſt men in the World) covering himſelf with his Shield, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Sword in his hand ſtept forth, and ſaid to the new Commer: <hi>'Tis with me Knight, 'tis with me, you have to do; and not with him, who is already tir'd by having ſo gallantly performed his Duty. Nor would it be reaſonable, that you, who are freſh, and unlabour'd, ſhould aſſail him ſo much to your Advantage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How?</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>Will you then hinder me from revenging my People, whom he had ſlain? Since you are ſo void of ſence, as thus to engage your ſelf in anothers Quarrel, ſtay, and you ſhall have the Chaſtiſement you deſerve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being ſaid, they began to charge each other with ſo much Fierceneſs, and Nimbleneſs, that the Spectators ſaid, they had never beheld a better Combat: of which <hi>Perion, Liſvart,</hi> and <hi>Olorius,</hi> were not a little glad, that they might know, by the Effect, whether he <hi>of the burning Sword</hi> was ſo good a Knight, as he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to be.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were doing, he in the black Armor had ſlain one of the two, with whom he was fighting, and was now ready to diſpatch the laſt, who by caſting himſelf at his Feet, and begging his Pardon, preſerv'd his Life. Yet the other, who fled to fetch Succour, minded him not, but ſet himſelf againſt the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> thinking, that, if he were defeated, the other in the black Arms would be more eaſily maſter'd. But as he was couching his Lance, to run againſt him, <hi>Olorius,</hi> catching hold of the Straps of his Shield, pull'd him with ſo much violence, that he brought him to the Ground, where he ſo treated him with the Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel of his Sword, that, the Laces of his Helmet breaking, his Head was diſarm'd. He then cry'd out for Mercy: but <hi>Olorius</hi> anſwer'd him: <hi>Raſcal, you ſhall dye: for the World cannot but be the worſe for your abiding in't:</hi> and with that lifting up
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:154293:60"/> his Fiſt, he gave him ſuch a blow on the Ear, with his Gantlet, as put an End to his Life.</p>
               <p>Already had the two others fought ſo long, that every one wondred at it, and yet neither of them appear'd in the leaſt weary'd, but ſtill continu'd better and better: wherefore <hi>Liſvart</hi> deſir'd <hi>Frandamella</hi> to go fetch the Emperor, and thoſe, that ſtay'd with him, aſſuring them, they ſhould ſee, what would give them Pleaſure. The Damſel ran to 'em, and told 'em, all ſhe had ſeen of the Combatants: wherefore they made haſt thither, where they found the two Knights ſtill as Active, as if they had but juſt begun.</p>
               <p>The ſame Moment arriv'd there alſo <hi>Axiana,</hi> who had ſtay'd behind, having a great Attendance of Ladies, Gentlewomen, Eſquires, and others. She was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fair, and of an excellent Meen, being mounted on a white Palfrey, adorn'd with Houſings of flower'd Cloth of Gold, hanging down on every ſide. But when ſhe ſaw the cruel Combat between the two Knights, and ſo great a Troop, amongſt whom ſhe diſcern'd thoſe at Liberty, whom ſhe was wont to keep Priſoners, never was Woman more aſtoniſht: for ſhe had not yet underſtood any thing of her loſs, which could not (had ſhe known it) have ſo much troubled her, as did the Danger, in which ſhe perceiv'd him in the Green Armor, whom ſhe lov'd better than her ſelf, to be: at which being wholly diſturb'd, and almoſt beſide her ſelf, ſhe was ready to ſink down in a ſwound. But ſhame hindring it, ſhe alighted off her Horſe, becauſe her Knight was fighting on foot.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Liſvart</hi> approacht, and making her a very low Reverence, askt her, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe pleas'd to have a Chair brought her out of the Caſtle, that ſhe might place her ſelf more at her eaſe.</p>
               <p>She, ſeeing him ſo fair, humble, and well behav'd, thus anſwer'd him: <hi>Knight, if my Eaſe would be any greater for being ſat, I would not refuſe this offer; but it is ſo diſturb'd by ſeeing the Danger of theſe two Combatants, that it would be impoſſible to be more: I nevertheleſs heartily thank you, and deſire you to tell me, who you are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Liſvart, who ever I am, you have in me, a Souldier, to ſerve and honor you, as I uſe to do all ſuch fair Ladies, as you are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ah!</hi> ſaid the Infanta, <hi>The Day will come, when I ſhall (perhaps) have a better Opportunity to thank you for this Civility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had continu'd their diſcourſe longer, had not the Peril, ſhe ſaw her Friend in, imploy'd her Thoughts on ſomewhat elſe. Nevertheleſs, neither of the two Knights could gain any thing over the other; but they ſo bravely maintain'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that for the Space of two long hours it was not known, to whom the greater Glory was to be attributed, they growing both ſo weary, that they were forc't to take breath, and reſt themſelves a little. I may well ſay <hi>a little:</hi> For the Green Knight, ſeeing the fair <hi>Axiana</hi> full of Trouble, and her Countenance pale, and without colour, thro' the great Perplexity, ſhe was in, was ſo mov'd, that parrying, what was left of his Shield, he recharg'd his Enemy with marvellous Fierceneſs. Nor
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:154293:61"/> was the other much behind him, ſo revenging himſelf, that the Graſs, on which they ſtood, grew red again, and the Spectators certainly thought, that they would both there leave their Lives, their Animoſity ſtill increaſing; ſo that they ſeiz'd each other by the Arms, ſtriving to gain that by ſtrength of Body, which they could not obtain by their Swords. Nevertheleſs it was impoſſible for either of them to get any Advantage over the other; but after much and long ſtrugling, with all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Induſtry, they return'd to their Swords, with which they laid ſo deſperately about them, that they had ſcarce any Armor left, with which they might cover, or defend themſelves: So that their bare Fleſh was ſeen, the Blood ſtreaming down on all ſides, and their Armor ready to drop off by pieces, if they fought any longer.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Axiana,</hi> no farther able to hear her Friends Danger, began to wring her hands, and croſs her Arms, like a Woman, pierc't with ſorrow. Which the green Knight ſeeing, took ſuch Courage, that (thinking to cleave his Enemies Head) he lift up his Sword with both hands, to which the other oppos'd his Shield; and yet the Blow was ſuch, that parting in two, what it met, the Point fell with ſuch Force on his Helmet, that his Eyes ſparkled, and he ſtagger'd, ready to fall to the ground. Nevertheleſs he ſoon recover'd, and to revenge himſelf, flew with ſuch Fury at him, who had ſo much out-rag'd him, that ſeizing the ſtraps of his Shield, he pull'd it ſo violently to him, that he got poſſeſſion of it, and threw it behind him in great ſpight. At which the Green Knight being amaz'd, as knowing the want he ſhould have of it, ſhew'd himſelf thence-forward more fearful, then he had till that time done: For he knew not, with what to cover himſelf, nor how any longer to reſiſt the other, who preſs'd him ſo cloſe, that every one evidently diſcern'd his Fortune to be adverſe, and that the Victory would certainly be the <hi>Knight</hi>'s <hi>of the burning Sword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">Ah! ha! poor <hi>Axiana!</hi> where it not better, you would find ſome means to ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them? Alas! why do you delay? You ſee your Friend at the laſt point of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and yet you remedy it not.</q> And to ſay true, ſhe was ſo troubled, and full of Bitterneſs, that ſhe could not utter ſo much as one word.</p>
               <p>At which <hi>Liſvart</hi> mov'd with Pity, could not forbear ſaying to her: <hi>I wonder, Madam, why you conſent thus to the Death of two ſuch Knights in your Preſence: Indeed you will do very ill, if you permit them to ſight any longer, For God's ſake then, ſince you can remedy it, ſeparate them, and deſire them at your requeſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Friends: And if they will not conſent for love, give order, that you be obey'd by force; or elſe the Loſs of them will be an incomparable wound to all Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, they being ſuch valiant men, as every one may ſee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alas he exactly hit on the Evil, that tormented her, nor could he at that time have made her any Diſcourſe, more agreeable to her. And therefore following <hi>Liſvarts</hi> Counſel, ſhe took Heart, and went ſtraight to the Combarants, who (in reſpect to her) retir'd at her approach.</p>
               <p>Then having her Face cover'd with Tears, ſhe began to ſay to them: <hi>I deſire you, Knights, that you will for my ſake deſiſt, and make Peace together: Which, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you will not refuſe me, ſince I beg it of you with ſuch Affection. And beſides,

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> hearing her ſpeake ſo ſweetly, was willing to let every one know, that he was no leſs affable, than valiant: wherefore he thus anſwer'd her: <hi>Madam I will obey you, if he, with whom I have to do, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it.</hi>

               <p>Then <hi>Axiana,</hi> continuing her Diſcourſe, ſaid: <hi>His Name is</hi> Lucencio; <hi>but we muſt deſire to be excus'd from giving you account of his Parentage: ſince neither he nor I know any thing of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As I live, Madam,</hi> anſwer'd the <hi>Knight, of the Burning Sword, it would be then very unſeemly for us two, between whom there is ſo great a Conformity, to fight one againſt the other: for I know my Father and Mother as little, as he does his, and this makes me think, that perhaps we may be Kinſmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, though ſpoken at random, was yet Truer, than he was aware: for they were both Coſens, he being Son to <hi>Liſvart</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Lucencio</hi> to <hi>Perſon</hi> of <hi>Gaul,</hi> the Fathers and the Children, being all four Aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the neither then, nor of a long time after, knowing one another. And to omit nothing that belongs to our Hiſtory, you ſhall know, how <hi>Axiana</hi> brought <hi>Lucencio</hi> into this Iſle of <hi>Argenes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You well remember, I believe the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Arrival at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> caus'd by a Tempeſt, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ave her Ship on the Coaſt of <hi>Thrace,</hi> as ſhe was conducting the fair Gentleman into Great <hi>Britain,</hi> there to receive the Order of Knighthood, and in what manner <hi>Lucencio</hi> undertook to go and fight the Knight, who had took the Helmet from the Gentlewoman, as you were told at large in the beginning of this Book. Now <hi>Axiana</hi> was ſhe, by whom he recovered what he ſought for, and to whom he promis'd alſo a Gift, for the Accompliſhment of which, he entred into her Veſſel, ſailing with her, till they came into the Iſle of <hi>Argenes,</hi> where going aſhore, <hi>Lucencio</hi> was, by <hi>Axiana,</hi> requir'd to keep the Seventh Tower of the Caſtle, in which was the Chamber of Treaſure: and this ſhe did by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of her Mother <hi>Zirfea,</hi> who gave her the Direction and Means of finding him, yet
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:154293:62"/> without telling her any thing of his Lineage. She perſwaded her indeed, that his Company would be very agreeable to her. And in this ſhe deceiv'd her not: for from their firſt Enterview they ſo mutually loved each other, that <hi>Axiana</hi> granted him, what ſhe moſt eſteem'd, provided he merited it by his Valour, of which he ſhould make proof, by keeping the Tower two whole Years. And he was now at the end of them, when Fortune brought into the Iſland the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> with whom he fought: for returning from Hunting, to which <hi>Axiana,</hi> to keep him from Melancholly, often took him, ſix of his Knights met him in the black Arms, and fell upon him, hoping to take him, and impriſon him, according to the Cuſtom. Now the Infanta ſtaid behind with <hi>Lucencio;</hi> but he, that fled from his Companions at their need, haſtned them; and they were both afterwards treated, as you have heard. Thus have we reſum'd the Thred of our Hiſtory, by returning to him, whom we had left at the beginning; but the Matter being now diſpos'd to bring him again upon the ſtage, you ſee him return with his green Armor and Shield, on which was painted the Bow, the Quiver, and the Arrow, to teſtify the Paſſion of his afflicted Heart, loving (as he did) the Queen of <hi>Argenes</hi> fair Daughter, to whom the Emperor, to let her underſtand the Pleaſure, he receiv'd by the Agreement of the two Knights, ſaid very reſpectfully: <hi>Indeed Madam, you this day oblige many worthy perſons, by ending the Quarrel between two ſuch Knights, as yours, and him</hi> of the burning Sword: <hi>And we muſt confeſs, that the great Beauty, with which Nature has endow'd you, has more prevail'd over them, than all we toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould have done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe ſhe had never ſeen the Emperor, <hi>Liſvart</hi> acquainted her, who he was. Now ſhe had hitherto thought him loſt, and could not imagin, in what manner ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, or any of the reſt, came into <hi>Argenes:</hi> Nevertheleſs converting at this time her wonder to a more ſuitable Diſcourſe, ſhe with very great Reſpect ſaid to him: <hi>Sir, I beſeech you to pardon me for not having at firſt made you the Reception you merit, for, had I known you, I would certainly have paid you the Reſpect, due to your Quality, not conſidering the ill will, I naturally ought to bear you, who partly caus'd the death of my neareſt Relations. But ſince they cannot be recall'd to life, reflecting, that rather through their own Unhappineſs, than otherwiſe, the Fortune of VVar treated them in this manner, <hi>I</hi> will attribute nothing to you, intreating you (at leaſt) to tell me, how the Guards of this place have ſo eaſily ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd your Abode here, and who has oblig'd them to ſet at liberty thoſe, whom I held in my Priſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>your Guards are defeated, and ſlain, in revenge of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Cuſtom, too long maintained by them under you, theſe three Knights and my ſelf having been miſerably inchanted, and laid to ſleep in the place, where the Queen your Mother has detain'd us, and alſo all theſe poor captive Strangers in Dungeons in very great miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This News could not but be very diſpleaſing to her, tho' ſhe then ſhew'd her ſelf rather conſtant, than vanquiſht with paſſion, ſaying to the Emperor: <hi>How? Are
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:154293:62"/> my people then defeated? and is my place loſt? VVell! Fortune however ſhall never have the power to make</hi> Axiana <hi>loſe the Magnanimity of Courage, which is natural to her, as being deſcended of ſo noble a Race: for knowing her inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the Moveableneſs of her wheel, I know well, ſhe cannot continue, or ſtand firm: and therefore I deſire you to give me leave, at leaſt, to retire with this Knight of mine; my VVomen and Servants ſhall, if you pleaſe, ſtay in this Caſtle, which the Gods will at ſome other time put again into my hands: and in the mean while, I ſhall learn in time to digeſt, what my heart thinks, and my Tongue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperor, hearing her ſpeak ſo diſcreetly, and without aſtoniſhment, greatly commended her in himſelf, and thus anſwer'd her: <hi>Madam, if you pleaſe to keep us company, Night now approaching, we will do you all the Honour we can; but if you like better to take ſome other way, you may freely do it, and thoſe alſo, that will follow you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> reply'd ſhe, <hi>you ſhew your ſelf ſo gracious to me, that I muſt give you thanks for ſo great Civility: Nevertheleſs the gods forbid, I ſhould grant my Enemy the Favour, which is in my power to deny him: I will go then (ſince you permit it) with a Reſolution never to re-enter this Caſtle, till it be mine again, as it was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſhe caus'd her Palfrey to be brought, on which the green Knight plac'd her, being very glad to ſee the Emperor of <hi>Trebiſond,</hi> of whom he was deſcended. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs fearing to diſpleaſe <hi>Axiana,</hi> he wiſely conceal'd his Thoughts, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Infanta, who with her Company returned the way ſhe came. And arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at her Houſe of pleaſure, where ſhe had Dined, ſhe incontinently cauſed her Knight to be diſarmed, for he was wounded in ſeveral places; but the Old Man, that carry'd the Falcon; when he found the King and the Ladies near the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, as you were told before, promis'd her, that he would ſoon put him out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſo expert he was in ſuch things.</p>

               <p>SCarce was <hi>Axiana</hi> gone a Bow ſhoot, when the Knight in the black Armor, came to pay his Duty to the Emperor, and putting his Knee to the ground, would have kiſs'd his Hands: to which the Emperor would not any way conſent; but lifting him up, ſaid: <hi>Knight, pray, let me know your Name, that I may give you a fitting Reception and Entertainment.</hi>

                  <hi>Living are they indeed, and there they are both,</hi> ſaid the Emperor, ſhewing them to him, who immediately went to ſalute them, and embracing them both, cry'd out aloud: <hi>Now have I before me, what I have moſt deſir'd to ſee!

               </p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>my Name is</hi> Balan, <hi>Son of</hi> Galeotes, <hi>whoſe Father, and my Grand-Father was</hi> Bravor, <hi>Lord of the Iſland of the</hi> Vermillian Tower. <hi>My Mother is</hi> Madaſima, <hi>Daughter to</hi> Don Galvanes, <hi>Lord of the Iſland of</hi> Mongaza, <hi>and I proteſt unto you, on my Faith, that I have no leſs deſire to employ my ſelf in your ſervice, than my Predeceſſors had, whom you know, hoping that the Amity you bare them, will not be leſs to me, who am their Iſſue.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Balan, ſaid <hi>Liſvart, you are very welcome: But tell us, what Adventure has brought you hither; and wherefore thoſe, whom you have vanquiſht, aſſail'd you thus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhall know that anſwer'd the Emperor, all in good time, but now let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. <hi>For the Night comes on, and I believe, both he, and the</hi> Knight of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sword, <hi>have more need of Reſt, than of longer Diſcourſe.</hi>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>h, with the cauſe of which, his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, I am going to acquaint you.</p>
               <p>It is recorded in the Hiſtory of <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> how <hi>Amadis</hi> marryed <hi>Bravor,</hi> Son to the Giant <hi>Balan,</hi> with the Daughter of <hi>Darioletta,</hi> and that of him deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Galeotes,</hi> of whom mention is made in the ſixth Volume of that Hiſtory. This <hi>Galeotes</hi> being at <hi>London,</hi> had News of his Fathers Death, but before his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the King caus'd him to Marry <hi>Madaſima,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Galvanes,</hi> whom he took along with him to the Iſland of the <hi>Vermillion Tower,</hi> where they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by his Subjects, who did him Homage, as their True and Natural Lord. The Year following <hi>Madaſima</hi> was brought to bed of a Son, whom from his great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father they nam'd <hi>Balan,</hi> and this is he of whom we now ſpeak. He then being come to the Age of Eighteen Years, as <hi>Galeotes</hi> and his Wife were one day toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Son, recreating themſelves on the Sea-ſhore, not any way diſtruſting Fortune, the Giant <hi>Gandalfe,</hi> Lord of the <hi>Sagittary Iſland,</hi> Sailing along that Coaſt, Arm'd and Equipp'd like a Pyrate, as he was, went aſhore to refreſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, where he ſurpriz'd <hi>Galeotes</hi> and his Company, whom he carry'd away Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: for they had neither Arms, nor time to get any; nor yet to retire into their
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:154293:63"/> Caſtle, of which the Giant made himſelf Maſter by ſurprize. Then <hi>Balan,</hi> young, and full of Courage, ſeeing this Misfortune befallen, and his Father and Mother Priſoners, was ready to dye for ſpight: and tho' he had not yet receiv'd the Order of Knighthood, he could not forbear ſaying to <hi>Gandalfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As GOD ſhall ſave me, Sir Knight, if the Right, you have uſurpt in this Countrey, were to be determin'd by Combat between you and me, I ſhould not queſtion, but to make you know, that you have Cowardly and Unjuſtly entred into it; and would ſend your head to King</hi> Amadis, <hi>whoſe Vaſſals we are, and whom, by treating us in this manner, you Affront.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of the <hi>Sagittary Iſland,</hi> was not a little diſpleas'd at this his Speech, which put him in ſuch a Rage, that he commanded <hi>Galeotes</hi> and <hi>Madaſima</hi> to be taken and whipt with the Horſes Reins in their Sons Preſence, to whom he ſaid: <hi>Hearken,</hi> Balan, <hi>I leave thee at Liberty to go where thou liſt, and receive Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, ſwearing to thee by the great God</hi> Iupiter, <hi>that I will ſtay for thee, and fight with thee, as ſoon as thou ſhalt Return. And that thou mayeſt have more Reaſon to make haſt, there ſhall not, by my Fathers ſoul, paſs a day, but theſe, whom thou haſt ſeen ſo well ſcourged, ſhall be yet more ſeverely handled in deſpight of thee, and thy King</hi> Amadis, <hi>that he and all others may know that I can chaſtiſe ſuch fools, as believe in any Gods but mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he commanded a Bark to be provided, into which <hi>Balan</hi> entred, very glad of the means, he had to proſecute his Revenge; but no leſs diſcontented for the Torment, in which he left <hi>Galeotes</hi> and <hi>Madaſima.</hi> To remedy which, he Sailed ſtraight into great <hi>Britain,</hi> and landed at the Port next to the Kay, where King <hi>Amadis</hi> was, daily beholding the great Actions, done by the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoys</hi> Knight. <hi>Balan</hi> acquainted the King with all, that had befallen <hi>Galeotes,</hi> who was much troubled at it, but, to comfort him, ſaid, that by the Grace of GOD he would provide to remedy it. Thus eight Days paſs'd, during which the Dutcheſſes Knight behaved himſelf ſo valiantly, that <hi>Balan</hi> beſought the King, he might receive from him the Order of Knighthood. This ſo pleas'd <hi>Amadis,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of the Week the Dutcheſſes Knight gave <hi>Balan</hi> the Order, tho' not though in white Harneſs, according to the Cuſtom, but in black Armor, with the Shield, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſcribed to you, ſignifying the Loſs of his Countrey, and the Impriſonment of his Parents. The new Knight then, having thank'd the King, and him, from whom he receiv'd that Honour, entred into his Bark, hoping in a little time to ſee and fight his Enemy. But it fell out quite contrary to his expectations; for the ſecond day after there aroſe ſuch a Tempeſt, that from time to and time he expected the loſs of himſelf and his Veſſel together, which being driven to fro, was at laſt caſt upon the Iſle of <hi>Argenes,</hi> where he went aſhore. And to know what Country it was, he took Horſe, and riding towards the Caſtle, where was then the Emperor of <hi>Trebiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>

                  </gap>, principally the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> who deſir'd to be his Friend and Companion: So that they paſs'd afterwards many Fortunes together, as you ſhall underſtand in the ſequal of this Diſcourſe. Now it hapned, that the next day, as the Emperor, with the Ladies, and the reſt of the Knights, were walking upon the Bridge near the firſt Tower, they perceiv'd coming towards them two Damſels in very good Equipage, accompanying a Litter, cover'd with Velvet, carry'd by two ambling Mules. Being come a little nearer the Knights, they ſtopt, to ask, which amongſt them was the Emperor of <hi>Trebiſond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Damſels,</hi> anſwer'd the Emperor, <hi>I am he: What is your Pleaſure?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid one of the Damſels, <hi>the Infanta</hi> Axiana <hi>my Miſtreſs intreats you to ſend her in this Litter the Knight, that fought yeſterday, aſſuring you, that he ſhall be every way better treated than he can be in this place, where amongſt other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, there wants a Chirurgion, as ſhe very well knows: And this Courteſy ſhe will do him in acknowledgment of that, he ſhew'd her yeſterday. And doubt not Sir, of his being very kindly entertain'd: For my Lady determins to honor him for his Virtue: Therefore conſider, what Anſwer to make.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Damſel,</hi> reply'd the Emperor, <hi>I ſhould be greatly ſatisfy'd to ſerve your Miſtreſs: But as to the Requeſt ſhe makes me, I aſſure you, I have no farther Power over the Knight, than what himſelf will give to my Entreaty. I ſhall indeed, and willingly, perſwade him to obay her, and if you will go along with me, you ſhall hear, what I will ſay to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid Balan, <hi>not to give you that trouble, I will, if you pleaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do the meſſage: And I believe, he will readily hearken to it, ſeeing the Condition, he is in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Go then,</hi> anſwer'd the Emperor, <hi>and bring us Word, aſſoon as poſſibly you can.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Balan</hi> departed, and went to the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> who was in his Bed by <hi>Gradamart, Gradafilea</hi> bearing them company, and entirely related to him <hi>Axiana</hi>'s Meſſage, telling him the Deſire, ſhe had to treat him, and that two of her Damſels had brought him a Litter in very good Equipage.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:154293:64"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>My dear Friend,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>Axiana does ſo much for me, that I know not how, during my whole life, I may be able to acknowledge this her Favour; yet will I not forſake my Companion</hi> Gradamart: <hi>So that if ſhe will have one, ſhe muſt have both together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well then,</hi> ſaid <hi>Balan, I will go and give them this Anſwer, and return to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with their Reply.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then going forth of the Chamber, he came to the Place, where the Emperor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting his Return, was diſcourſing with the Damſels to whom <hi>Balan</hi> declar'd the Intention of the <hi>Knight of the burning Sowrd:</hi> Which, when they had heard, they anſwer'd, that <hi>Axiana</hi> had in like manner commanded them to make the ſame Requeſt to <hi>Gradamart,</hi> if he were living: For ſhe lov'd him, and much doubted of his being in a worſe Condition.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Lucella</hi> underſtood, that her Friend was to remove, ſhe chang'd her Colour above ten times in leſs than a moments ſpace, one while pale, preſently red, now penſive, then inconſtant, diſſembling nevertheleſs, as much as was poſſiible, the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Paſſion, which caus'd ſuch an Alteration in her: And with the beſt aſſurance, ſhe could, ſhe return'd to accompany the Queen, and the Damſels, into the Chamber of the wounded Knights, who were without delay carry'd by four Servants, and put into the Litter.</p>
               <p>Now the Meſſengers had not yet taken notice of <hi>Lucella</hi>'s Beauty, which they no ſooner beheld, but they durſt to affirm, that Nature had never produc'd any thing, more excellent, or more worthy of Admiration. And immediatly they took their Leave of the Company, the two Knights promiſing the Ladies to make a ſpeedy Return, if it pleas'd Heaven to be aſſiſting to their Cure.</p>
               <p>Removing then, they went gently on, for fear of diſturbing the Wounds of the Knights, yet nevertheleſs they came before Sun-ſet to <hi>Axiana</hi>'s Palace, which was wonderfully built: For the whole Building was of Iaſper, Porphiry, white, gray, and black Marble, with a vaſt Number of Towers and Turrets, along which were many guilded Pipes, receiving the Waters from four great Parts of the Houſe in a Square, the Walls of which, within and without were enricht with the moſt curious work, that <hi>Apelles</hi> ever wrought, either in Imagery or Painting. To this Palace was adjoyning a Park, containing in compaſs ſix great Leagues, full of ſo many Curioſities, that I know not, whether the Palace of <hi>Apolidon</hi> could ſhew any thing beyond them: For <hi>Zirfea</hi> had employ'd all her Skill to render it perfectly curious, having beautify<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d with whatever Art or Nature could afford, as you ſhall hereafter underſtand. And tho' the two wounded Knights were in ſo much Pain, that Reſt was much more convenient for them, than their Amuſing themſelves, either in beholding or diſcourſing about Buildings; yet having heard the Damſels by the way relate the Perfection of the Place, they took ſo great Pleaſure in viewing its Out-ſide, that they ſcarce thought of entring in, when <hi>Axiana,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of their Arrival, by a Page, came to receive them with ſuch a Countenance, as
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:154293:65"/> ſhew'd her more content and ſatisfy'd, than if ſhe had regain'd her Caſtle, and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Treaſure, ſhe had loſt.</p>
               <p>Which the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> perceiving, ſaid to her: <hi>Madam, you have been ſo mindful of our Healths, that ſhould we dye a thouſand times in your ſervice, yet can we never recompence favour we receive from you: But the as the Sun is natually bright, and cannot be otherwiſe; ſo you being deſcended of the houſe, you are, and ſo well educated, cannot ſhew your ſelf other than wiſe, prudent, fair, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, uſing Sweetneſs and Courteſy, as that, with which you are born, and which naturally, accompanies you to render you the moſt accompliſht of Ladies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir Knight,</hi> anſwer'd ſhe, <hi>you give me great and undeſerv'd Praiſes, for that which I could not have omitted, without offending againſt the three principal Points, requiſit to a Perſon of my Condition. The firſt of which is, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in time of Adverſity the Pleaſure one has receiv'd from ones Enemy, letting every one know, that he, who, when afflicted, can requite a Favor, has alſo the Means to avenge himſelf of the Injuries ſuffer'd, during his Misfortune. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, to ſhew ones ſelf at all times civil and compaſſionate, as occaſion requires. And the third, never ſo to trouble ones Mind, for any Diſcontents or Croſſes, which may happen, but that Reaſon and Diſcretion ſtill keep the upper hand. And theſe three Points are evidently neceſſary to all generous Perſons, for the preſerving their Greatneſs always firm and unchangeable: For undecaying Virtue renders a perſon much more noble and exalted, than all the corruptible Goods of Fortune, which are always ſubject to her Paſſions and Inconſtancy, and but too often beſtow'd on ſuch, as never deſerv'd them. But 'tis quite otherwiſe with Virtue; for he alone obtains it, who does Acts worthy the gaining it: And for it alone, ought men to be eſteem'd, and honour'd, yea, and reputed Richer, than if they poſſeſs'd all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the word: Becauſe the true and never fading Riches, is the Renown of good and heroick Actions, perform'd by the vertuous Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> hearing her ſpeak with ſuch a Grace, conceiv'd a very great Eſteem for her: But ſhe was Daughter of one of the diſcreeteſt Ladies in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and of Prince <hi>Olorius</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> a moſt wiſe and prudent Knight, from whom it would have been difficult for her to have degenerated. And to ſpeak true, when we conſider the tenderneſs of her Age joyn'd with her Diſcretion, Nature ſhew'd in her a Maſter-piece, admirably well deſerving the higheſt Commendations. Wherefore he reſol'd to do her all the Honor, he could, and ſhe very courteouſly embrac'd him. Then were he and <hi>Gradamart</hi> brought into a fair Chamber, where, being laid in two ſeveral Beds, they were viſited by the old Knight, whom we formerly mention'd, who, thro' his great skill, and long Experience, ſav'd their Lives, as he had done of many other valiant men, who held themſelves therefore very much oblig'd to him.</p>

                  <p>How the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> caus'd <hi>Axiana's</hi> Caſtle to be reſtored to her, and the Diſcourſe the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and ſhe had together.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>FOur whole days did the</hi> Knight of the burning Sword <hi>and</hi> Gradamart, <hi>continue under the Old Mans Hand, without any diſcerning of Amendment in them, till towards the end of the Week, when the Feavor left them, and their Wounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Heal.</hi> Axiana <hi>in the mean time treated them in the beſt manner, ſhe could imagin, and ſent to deſire the King of</hi> Sicily, <hi>that he would come and viſit them. Which he very readily did,</hi> Gradafilea <hi>alſo bearing him Company.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They then being come to the Infanta's Houſe, whilſt</hi> Gradafilea <hi>was entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Brother</hi> Gradamart, <hi>the King of</hi> Sicily <hi>diſcours'd with the</hi> Knight of the burning Sword, <hi>who falling from one matter to another, the Knight began to ſay to him:</hi> Sir, tho' the little Service I have hitherto done you, is ſo far from deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Recompence, that it merits not the leaſt Thanks, nevertheleſs, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Goodneſs, Liberality, and courteous Diſpoſition, as you alſo, I believe, have already ſome Aſſurance, how much I am yours, and into what danger I would put my Perſon for any thing, that might redound to your Service; I have taken the boldneſs to make you the Requeſt, you will hear. You know, Sir, in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the <hi>Chamber of Treaſure</hi> was Conquer'd, and the Guards ſlain, at which (as 'tis to be thought) the Infanta <hi>Axiana</hi> receiv'd a double Diſcontent: And never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs for my deſiſting at her Requeſt from the Combat againſt her Knight <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencio,</hi> which was as great a Benefit to my ſelf, as to him, ſhe has taken ſuch care of my Health, that, laying aſide all the ill Will, ſhe might reaſonably bear me, ſhe has ſo preferr'd Virtue, that 'twere impoſſible for the greateſt Prince in the World to be more honour'd, or better treated: Which has conſtrain'd me, Sir, humbly to beſeech you, that you will be pleas'd to give me, what we have won from her, to the end I may make her a Preſent of it, acknowledging in ſome manner the great Civility ſhe has ſhewn me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King, who deſir'd nothing more than to pleaſe and ſatisfy him, being very glad of this Overture, thus anſwer'd him:</hi> My dear Friend, I could wiſh you had askt alſo of me the three beſt Citys of my Kingdoms, that I might have had an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſhewing you how ſenſible I am of the Obligations you have laid on me, who owe you even my Life: as for what you now requeſt of me, you alone have the Abſolute Right to diſpoſe of it, at your pleaſure, having purchas'd it with your blood; it ſeems therefore injurious to me, to ask me that which is already your own, and in which I have no part: but if you pleaſe to accept of any thing that belongs to me, you ſhall freely have it, how dear ſoever it is to me.</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:154293:66"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Knight of the burning Sword <hi>very humbly thank'd him. This Diſcourſe was ſcarce ended, when the Infanta, who had been to viſit her Friend</hi> Lucencio, <hi>came in. The King immediately went to ſalute her, with his Knee, in a manner, to the Ground, and ſhe, who was of an Accompliſht Behaviour receiv'd him very humbly. Then they ſat down in two Chairs, near to the Knight, who, addreſſing himſelf to her, thus began his Diſcourſe:</hi> Madam, you have already done me ſuch Favours, that 'tis impoſſible for ſo poor a Knight, as I am, ever to return you ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Thanks: I have nevertheleſs, by my Entreaties, ſo far prevail'd with the King, that he has, of his Liberality, been pleas'd to beſtow on me the Place, you loſt ſome few days ſince, to the end I may reſtore it into your hands, which I very willingly do: entreating you, that of your wonted Goodneſs, you will pardon me the death of your people, who (undoubtedly) ended their daies, more thro' the ill Cuſtom of the place, they kept, than for any Deſire I had to do you a diſcourteſy. Therefore, Madam, with Thanks to the King, you will pleaſe to accept this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to eſteem me, as one, who would hazard his life, and whatever elſe is dear to him, for your Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tho'</hi> Axiana <hi>was exceedingly overjoy'd at her ſo eaſy recovering, what ſhe deſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of, yet concealing the Exceſs of her Ioy, ſhe modeſtly thus anſwer'd him:</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, good Knight, the Offer you ſo liberally make me, and the Diſpleaſure I have receiv'd in loſing, what you have gain'd from me and mine, put me in great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; becauſe, conſidering in what manner my place has been conquer'd, and then reſtor'd, and put into my hands, my honour ſeems not however to be ſatisfied, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Death of my men were reveng'd as ſeverely as the greatneſs of the Offence deſerves, not ſo much in reſpect of them, as of my perſon, againſt which, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Injury has been committed, and which ought to have a ſuitable ſatisfaction. And on the other ſide, the Favour, Benefit, and Honour I receive from the King and you, ſummons me to forget all paſt Offences, not ſo much for the value of the thing you preſent me, as to take away the Opinion, that might be conceived, not only of my ingratitude, but that the cauſe of my Refuſal proceeds from a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of ever being able to return you the like: Which, the Gods forbid ſhould befall <hi>Axiana,</hi> and much leſs, that ſhe ſhould ſhew in the State and Rank ſhe bears any mean ſpiritedneſs, which is a Fault, that never ſhe or any of her Lineage were guilty of. And therefore conforming the Time to my Fortune, my Thanks for the Reſtitution you make me, ſhall be ſuch, that I wait for ſome time to requite you, not as for a Benefit beſtow'd on the Queen of <hi>Argenes</hi> Daughter, but as a bounty, proceeding from ſuch noble Perſons to me, who expected it not. In the mean time you ſhall have, for a pledge, my good Will, with what ever elſe is in my power.</p>
               <p>Ah! Madam, <hi>ſaid the King,</hi> I will no longer contend with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well knowing, that your Courteſy can overcome a much better ſpeaker than I am: but let it ſuffice you, that all thoſe, who ſee you, fall into a Deſire of doing you ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:154293:66"/> which Deſire brings with it ſo much force, that every Knight who ſerves you, thinks himſelf well recompens'd, if his ſervice is agreeable to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now</hi> Axiana <hi>had not yet perceiv'd</hi> Gradafilea, <hi>who, to hear what they ſaid, left her Brother, and came towards her. Then they ſaluted each other very courteouſly. They had not however any long Diſcourſe together: for Night drew on, and the King of</hi> Sicily <hi>would return, whence he had parted in the morning. Which</hi> Axiana <hi>knowing, beſought him, and</hi> Gradafilea <hi>alſo, not to forget the Way, but to bring thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the next day the Queen and</hi> Lucella, <hi>with all the reſt, whom ſhe would enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the beſt manner, ſhe could: and upon this they gave her the good Fight. And coming down into the Court, they took Horſe, and went back to the Caſtle of the</hi> Chamber of Treaſure, <hi>where they were very well receiv'd, eſpecially by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who deſiring to know in what diſpoſition the two wounded Knights were, the King was oblig'd to relate to them, more than once, all he had ſeen and heard. And in the mean time, the</hi> Knight of the burning Sword <hi>and</hi> Lucencio, <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times viſited each other, whence they began together ſuch a Friendſhip, as laſted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after.</hi>

                  <p>How the Emperor of <hi>Trebiſond,</hi> the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and all the others, as well Knights, as Ladies, and Gentlewoman, that were in the Caſtle of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Treaſure, went to ſee <hi>Axiana:</hi> And of the Wonders ſhe ſhew'd them.</p>

               <p>SO well did the did Knight order thoſe he had undertaken to cure, that he ſet them on their Legs ſound and luſty: At which the Infanta <hi>Axiana</hi> much rejoycing, and deſirous to treat the Emperor and his Company, requeſted the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> and <hi>Gradamart,</hi> to go, and deſire their Company at her houſe, where ſhe deſign'd to feaſt them.

Then the two Knights told thoſe of the Caſtle <hi>Axiana</hi>'s Deſire, to ſatisfy which, they reſolv'd to ſet forth immediatly.

A little higher, on a ſmall riſing, was a Thicket of Codars &amp; Plain-trees, whither repair'd all ſorts of Animals, wild and tame.

               <p>
                  <hi>Liſvart</hi> and <hi>Perion,</hi> wondering at this Acquaintance, knew not what to think of it: Nevertheleſs they took at that time no notice, but after they had receiv'd her, as ſhe deſerv'd, ſhe ſaid to them: <hi>My Lords, my Father, and</hi> Vrganda <hi>ſalute you in all humility, and ſend you word, by me, that for your Good you enter without Delay into this Ship, ſince 'tis requiſit, you be henceforth ſeen by thoſe, who have deſir'd you, and are in very great Pain for your Abſence. Therefore conſider if you will believe their Counſel, for they love you, and deſire your profit, as you have often enough experimented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperor (who had been of Opinion, he ſhould never ſee the Day or Means to return into <hi>Trebiſond</hi>) conſidering, that <hi>Alquif</hi> and <hi>Urganda</hi> ſent them not ſuch a Meſſage without occaſion, anſwer'd before them all: <hi>My great Friend, I think, that none of us would diſobey Perſons to whom we are ſo much bound.

               <argument>
                  <p>How <hi>Malfadea,</hi> Daughter to the Giant of the great <hi>Siclades,</hi> came to ask help of King <hi>Amadis,</hi> who went with her, to revenge her of the Giant <hi>Maſearon.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the beginning of this Hiſtory, you have been told, how King <hi>Amadis</hi> took a ſingular Delight, in ſeeing the Feats of Arms, every day perform'd by the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of <hi>Savoys</hi> Knight, who kept the Kay, whether he had caus'd his Tents and Pavilions to be brought, ſo that he ſtay'd there four whole Months: during which 'tis incredible, what a Number of Shields were loſt by ſeveral gallant Men, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Cuſtom, eſtabliſht at the Paſſage. At which, the King conceived ſuch a Love for the Knight, that, to draw him to his Service, and continual Reſidence about his Perſon, he ſhew'd him great Honour and Sign of Love.</p>
               <p>Now it hapned one day amongſt others, that his Huntſmen brought him Word of a great Wild Boar, which they had found in a Thicket near the Sea-ſide. The King, who lov'd Hunting, commanded preſently the Toils to be ſpread, and with his Grey-hounds, Hounds, and other great Dogs brought him to a Bay, and at laſt kill'd him with a Bore-Spear. And becauſe he found himſelf weary, he went to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh himſelf on the Sand, where he had not been long, when he ſaw a Boat, brought to the Shore by two Mariners, and with them a Damſel, carrying on her Shoulders two Giants Heads, one a Mans, the other a Womans. She, of whom I ſpeak to you, ſhew'd ſo much ſorrow, that a pityleſs heart would have been mov'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</p>
               <p>The King, and thoſe who were with him, drew near to hear the Cauſe of this Sorrow, and what Adventure brought this Woman thither. But ſhe prevented them, asking them with Tears in her Eyes, if they could direct her to King <hi>Amadis,</hi> the Rampart and Refuge of ſuch deſolate Perſons, as ſhe was.</p>
               <p>The King hearing, that ſhe deſir'd to ſpeak with him, anſwer'd mildly: <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, I am he, what would you have with me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this word the Gianteſs proſtrated her ſelf at his Feet, and increaſing her tears and ſighs ſaid to him: <hi>Alas! if in the time, when you were a Knight Errant, you ſought ſtrange Adventures, to repair Wrongs and Outrages, eſpecially ſuch, as were done to Widows and Orphans, now that you are King, Reaſon obliges you not to leave this ſo good, holy, and juſt Cuſtom. For GOD beſtows not his Favours and great Benefits on ſuch, as you are, but for the Preſervation of Juſtice, and Aſſiſtance of the Poor, who are all ſtript of Relief, as I am.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Friend,</hi> anſwer'd the King, <hi>you ſay true, and certainly I will do ſo, if I can, whenever I ſhall have Opportunity: Wherefore delay not to acquaint me with your Grief, aſſuring you, that I will remedy it as far as I am able.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:154293:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>O good Prince,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>with this hope I am come to you, and moſt humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to grant me a gift, which 'tis neceſſary you ſhould do, if you intend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge me of the wrong that is done me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I grant it you,</hi> anſwer'd the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Underſtand, Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>that the Gift you have given me, is, that you alone, being Arm'd, enter preſently into my Boat, to the end you may revenge me of the wicked Perſon that has ſlain my Father and Mother, whoſe Heads theſe are: and the Remainder, Sir, I will tell you at leiſure, as we are ſailing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In good faith,</hi> anſwer'd the King, <hi>it ſhall not be my fault, if your Will is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted: for I will follow you, where-ever you deſire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Certainly,</hi> ſaid the Damſel, <hi>this Confidence I have always had in your Vertue and Goodneſs, therefore ſend for your Arms, and let us go.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King call'd the Count <hi>Gandalin,</hi> and commanded him to fetch them with out ſaying a word to the Queen, or any other, till ſuch time as he was departed. The Count obey'd his Command, tho' very unwillingly: but knowing his Maſters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition, who would rather dye, than break his word, he went on. Nor was it long, e're he return'd, and the King arm'd himſelf, bidding King <hi>Arban</hi> acquaint the Queen, with what he had ſeen, and deſire her in his Name not to be troubled for him. Then he went into the Boat, and, without knowing whether he went, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Sail, leaving his People in a wonderful fear of loſing him.</p>
               <p>And becauſe you may, Readers, think it ſtrange, that this good King, who was fourſcore years old, could yet undertake the Execution of ſuch an Adventure, you muſt underſtand, that in his time the moſt magnanimous Knight, and of the greateſt Courage, that could be found. Nor were the days of Men ſo ſhort then, as they are now: for they liv'd ſome Two Hundred, nay ſome Three Hundred Years and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And which is more, the Vertue of the Water, wherewith <hi>Urganda</hi> the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known</hi> waſht him in the Palace of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> when ſhe enchanted him, was very Advantageous to him in this Affair.</p>
               <p>But to return to our Story, King <hi>Arban,</hi> having follow'd King <hi>Amadis</hi> with his Eye, till he was out of ſight, came to the Queen, and acquainted her with the King's Command, at which ſhe became ſo troubled, that fetching a deep ſigh, ſhe began to ſay: <hi>Good GOD, the King's great Heart is an Enemy to his Perſon, and to me, ſeeing the Dangers it expoſes him to at every turn! Alas! is it not time for him now to reſt, and leave ſuch youthful matters to be undertaken by ſo great a Number of good Knights, who deſire nothing elſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Angriote, you ſay true: but what? the King, who is born to gain to himſelf alone the Honour of all, deſires thus to do, and to leave nothing behind for us, thinking, by the great Benefits, he beſtows on us, ſufficiently to ſatisfy us for the Service and good Will, we bear him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many others endeavour'd to comfort Queen <hi>Oriana,</hi> to whom they alledg'd ſo many Reaſons, that at laſt ſhe took ſome of them in payment, knowing no better
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:154293:70"/> Remedy: wherefore ſhe reſolv'd to return to <hi>London.</hi> Leaving therefore the Knight of the Kay, and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> in the Protection of our Lord, ſhe departed the next morning betimes.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How <hi>Malfadea</hi> the Gianteſs related her Misfortune to King <hi>Amadis:</hi> and of the Diſcourſe, they had together.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>KIng</hi> Amadis, <hi>being thus gone off from the Coaſt of great</hi> Britain, <hi>and ſeeing his Guide a little pacify'd, requeſted her to acquaint him with the occaſion of her Parents Death, and her Diſcontent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This ſhe willingly granted, ſaying to him:</hi> Your Majeſty will be pleas'd to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that my Father was Lord of the great <hi>Siclades,</hi> ſo call'd for being lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and larger than any other of the four and fifty Iſlands. And tho' he was a Giant, yet had he many good and vertuous Cuſtoms: he was very juſt, compaſſionate, and a Practiſer of friendly Hoſpitality towards his Neighbours. One of which, who was a wicked and traiterous Diſſembler, abuſing this my Fathers Courteſy and good Nature, pretended to be ſo much his Friend, that he lov'd him above all others.</p>
               <p>He, of whom I ſpeak, and who is nam'd <hi>Maſcaron,</hi> came not above fifteen days ſince, with a Couſin of his into the great <hi>Siclades,</hi> where they were very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. Now the next day after dinner, this Villain askt my Father, that he might have my Company to walk in the Garden. My Father, innocent of the Raſcals Malice, commanded me to go along with him: and <hi>Maſcaron</hi> and I were ſome time together without his ſpeaking any thing that might diſpleaſe me: but at laſt he pray'd me to grant him my Love.</p>
               <p>I then, being much amaz'd, frankly anſwer'd him, that I would rather dye, than do this Injury to my Lineage, ſetting before his Eyes the good Entertainment, and great Reception, my Father had given him, to which he ought to have regard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Say you ſo?</hi> ſaid he. <hi>Yet muſt you obey me, whether you will or no: nevertheleſs</hi> I <hi>pray you, it may be by Amity, and not by force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Certainly,</hi> anſwer'd I then to him, <hi>I would firſt kill my ſelf with mine own hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this, my Refuſal hindred him not from attempting to defile me by force, which made me cry out ſo loud, that my Father, who was then diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with <hi>Maſcarons</hi> Couſin, came to my Aſſiſtance, asking me the cauſe of my Cry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alas,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>this Villain would have diſhonour'd me by force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Father, not without cauſe, provokt hereat, ſtoop'd down to take up a ſtick, which lay at his Feet, and before he could get up again, the Traytor, drawing a Scymeter, which hung at his ſide, gave him ſuch a Blow on the neck, that he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated his head from his Body.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:154293:70"/>
               <p>Then I poor wretch began in ſuch ſort to howl and lament, that my ſorrowful Mother came to me, who finding my Father thus murder'd, and the Scymeter in the hands of his murderer, flew at him, and like a furious Lioneſs, which ſees her man, overwhelmed with Deſpair, could in ſuch a caſe do. And ſhe had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt kill'd him, but that the other, taking his part, firſt threw my Mother on the Ground, and then drawing his Sword, murder'd her.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Maſcaron</hi> took me by the hair, telling me, that, to make me ſuffer the more he would not kill me, as he had done the reſt, but would force me on the Bodies of my murder'd Parents, that I might receive the greater injury: and thus he executed his damn'd and unhappy Will, what Reſiſtance or Threat ſoever I made him.</p>
               <p>Then he kickt me on the Belly, ſaying to me: <hi>Go, wretched Creature, ſeek who may honour thee more, or reſtore thee the Eſtate, thou expectedſt to enjoy for the future.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And leaving me alone, he, and his Couſin return'd to the Caſtle, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving moſt inhumanly butcher'd many poor Servants, they took poſſeſſion of it, and keep it ſtill.</p>
               <p>Which I ſeeing, took the Heads, you may here behold, and entred into this Boat, attended by this Servant of mine, who has brought me to you for Refuge: and ſo indeed I commanded him, having often heard it affirm'd, that you never fail'd your Aſſiſtance to any poor deſolate Woman.</p>
               <p>In this manner, Sir, all has paſt, and this is the unhappy end of thoſe, from whom I had my Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then ſhe fell a weeping ſo bitterly, that it ſeem'd, as if ſhe would have melted into Tears. At which the Kings heart was in ſuch manner touch'd with Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that he could ſcarce forbear weeping: wherefore he ſaid to her:</hi> This certainly is the greateſt and moſt Villamous Treaſon, that could be imagin'd, and which I have good hopes not to leave unpuniſh'd.</p>
               <p>Alas, Sir, <hi>anſwer'd ſhe,</hi> I beſeech GOD to be aiding to you herein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus went King</hi> Amadis <hi>and</hi> Malfadea <hi>diſcourſing with ſo good a Wind, that the Thirteenth Day after they arriv'd within Twenty Miles of the great</hi> Siclades. <hi>Which the Mariners let the King underſtand, aſſuring him, they ſhould come to Harbor the next day before eight a Clock.</hi>
               </p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the Emperor of <hi>Trebiſond,</hi> the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and their Company, failing by Night, there paſs'd by them a Boat, in which was a Knight, and a Lady that wept bitterly.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE not long ſince told you, in what manner the Emperor and his Company put to Sea at their departure from the Iſle of <hi>Argenes,</hi> at which there was not any of them, but was greatly pleas'd, hoping to go ſtrait to <hi>Trebiſond:</hi> but they counted without their Hoſt; and indeed very great Dammage would have been caus'd by it: to prevent which <hi>Alquifa</hi> was ſent to them, as you will underſtand in the following Chapter.</p>
               <p>This Company then Sailing the ſpace of a whole Month, without knowing whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or which way they went, the Veſſel being guided of it ſelf without any Pilot or Governour, (for ſo had the wife <hi>Alquifa</hi> ordain'd) it one night hapned, that the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> not being able to Sleep for thinking on his Love, heard the Moans of a Woman, lamenting, as he thought, and bitterly weeping: wherefore he awakned his Companion <hi>Gradamart,</hi> to whom he bare a ſingular Friendſhip, and askt him, whether he had heard this Complaint: <hi>for,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it ſeems to me to be ſome of our Damſels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have well heard the Complaint,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Gradamart, but it comes from far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, and to ſhew 'tis ſo, the Water carries away the noiſe by little and little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God never help me then,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword, if I do not go to know, what it means.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And do you think,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Gradamart, that I will ſtay behind?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then they got haſtily up, and wrapping themſelves in their Cloaks, came upon the Deck, where they enquir'd of the Mariners, if they had ſeen any one paſs that way, who wept or made any noiſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yes,</hi> anſwer'd ſome of them, <hi>'twas a Damſel, whom a Knight carries away in a Boat, with two Oars.</hi>

                  <hi>As God ſhall help me,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword, he forces her then, and 'twould ill become me to have ſo long born Arms, and not to remedy it; and 'tis probable, I heard not this noiſe without the Will of the Heavenly Powers, who would have me to look after it. And therefore, Sir</hi> Gradamart, <hi>I deſire you to help me arm my ſelf: for I would not for any thing in the world delay to follow them in our Skiff, with one or two of our Mariners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Gradamart, do you think my Friendſhip to you ſo little, that I would let you go thus alone? On my ſoul, tho' you ſo far diſdain'd me, yet will I not forſake you, without having ſhare in the good or evil, that may befall you by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> heard him ſpeak with ſuch Affection, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that he had diſpleas'd him, he embrac'd him, and ſaid to him: <hi>Pardon me, my
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:154293:71"/> dear Friend, for I ſwear to you by our great Gods, that no other thing made me uſe this Language to you, but the fear of over toiling you: for I have more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in your Company, than in any other I can keep. And therefore I promiſe you, that I will not henceforth tranſgreſs your Commands, but diſpoſe of me, as you ſhall pleaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Gradamart</hi> made a ſign to the Mariners to let down the Skiff into the Sea, and in the mean time they went to Arm themſelves the moſt ſecretly they could, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, leſt the King, or ſome other, might divert their Enterprize. Being Arm'd, they went forth of the great Ship, taking only two Men to guide them, whom they commanded to ſteer their Courſe that way, they had heard the voice complain charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the others on their Lives to ſay nothing of their Departure, till the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when they ſhould, in their Names, beſeech the Emperor to ſtay for them two days, if it were poſſible.</p>
               <p>Then the Skiff began to Sail, and thoſe of the Ship did, as he had commanded them: for day being come, the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> thinking to go and viſit the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> and not finding him, where he was wont to teſt, knew from the Mariners, in what manner <hi>Gradamart</hi> and he, was departed, at which he was very much diſpleas'd, as was alſo <hi>Lucella,</hi> till ſhe knew, what they had requeſted of the Emperor, which was to ſtay for them.</p>
               <p>But a Tempeſt, ariſing at break of day, contradicted it: ſo that 'twas impoſſible for them to bring the Ship to Anchor, but they were forc'd to remove, whether they would or no, and follow Fortune, <hi>Alquifa</hi> perſwading them, that all this was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd by Myſtery, add that the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> and <hi>Gradamart</hi> would be found again in time. And, in the mean while, we will return to the King of great <hi>Britain,</hi> who was Sailing with <hi>Malfadea.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>How King <hi>Amadis</hi> went a ſhore in the great <hi>Siclades,</hi> and ſought againſt <hi>Maſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron:</hi> And of the Danger, he was in, from which he was deliver'd by the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> and <hi>Gradamart,</hi> who came thither in good time for him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>GRadamart,</hi> and the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> caus'd their two Mariners to row with all the ſpeed they could, that they might overtake him, who carry'd away the Damſel, as you have been told, whom they diſcover'd about break of day, at wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch they receiv'd great Satisfaction, hoping he ſhould never eſcape from them. And following him with great haſt, when it had been now day a full hour, they ſaw him go a ſhore on a neighbouring Iſland, and one of thoſe, who guided the Boat, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a ſtrong Caſtle, whence he ſoon return'd to the Knight, who ſtay'd for him on the Sand.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:154293:72"/>
               <p>Then they ſtay'd a while together, and a little after perceiv'd coming towards them a Giant compleatly arm'd, and with him another Giant, and ſome Number of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unarm'd: Wherefore the Knight embrac'd his Shield, &amp; lacing down his Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, took his Sword in his hand, and march'd ſtraight to the Giant, who put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in like readineſs to fight. Then they began ſo furiouſly to charge each other, that the ſparks of Fire flew from their Armor, as from a Furnace, blown with a Smiths Bellows. And thus they held on, curting each others Shields, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riveting their Armor, ſo that the beſt of them was in a manner naked, the Knight of The Boat ſhewing himſelf ſo Active, Couragious, and Nimble, that he often made his Enemy loſe his Blow, and treated him ſo ill, that the Blood ran out in many places from his Fleſh.</p>
               <p>At which the Giant grew very fearful, and ſeeing his End near, cry'd out with a loud voice: <hi>Couſin, Couſin, and you my men, revenge me of this Devil: For if he were Mortal, he could never have done, what you have ſeen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ah Villain,</hi> ſaid the Knight, <hi>doſt thou think thus to preſerve thy Life? By my head, all the help of theſe Traitors ſhall not ſave thee from my hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſaid this, he began to preſs him more cloſe, than he had done all the day, and the Giant did nothing but parry to his Blows, expecting his Men, who were all gone to fetch their Arms at the Caſtle. Whence they haſtily return'd, and fell upon the Knight of the Boat, whom they encompaſt on all ſides.</p>
               <p>Now a little before the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> and <hi>Gradamart,</hi> who had from a far, ſeen the beginning of the Fight, began to ſay to one another: <hi>Behold, how much we were deceiv'd: He, who, we thought, carry'd away the Damſel by force is come to revenge her of ſome Injury, ſhe has receiv'd from this Giant: Let us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and ſee, how 'twill go.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then they commanded their Mariners to draw to the ſhore, and the nearer they approacht, the more they wondred, who he was, that fought ſo valiantly, and, as they might plainly ſee, manag'd his Enemy at his Pleaſure. But they perceiv'd the Aſſiſtance come, and aſſail him on all ſides: Nevertheleſs the Knight ſo well defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelf, ſeeing his Death before his Eyes, that he ſeem'd, as if he had not ſtruck a Blow all the day, tho' he had to do with two Giants, and twenty others, as well Servants, as Eſquires, by whom he was ſo moleſted, that 'twas a Wonder, how he could bear up againſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gradamart,</hi> and the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> who were in their Skiff, making towards the Shore, drew near the Boat, in which the Damſel was remaining, who, wringing her Hands, and tearing her Hair, made the dolefuleſt Lamentation in the world, curſing and banning Fortune, which was ſo contrary and injurious to her. Then the <hi>Knight of the burning ſword</hi> askt her, why ſhe lamented in that manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alas! Sir</hi> anſwer'd the, <hi>if there is in you any goodneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for GOD's ſake ſuccor this good Knight, who has, for my right, undertaken this hard Combat againſt the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:154293:72"/> moſt cruel and traitorous Giant, that ever was born of Woman, who, violating his Faith and Promiſe: thus diſloyally cauſes King</hi> Amadis <hi>to be aſſaulted, whom you may ſee in the danger he is for my ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> heard the Damſel ſay, that he, who fought againſt ſo many, was the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> he greatly wondred, and ſpake thus to <hi>Gradamart: Indeed, I believe that whatever Fame has heretofore publiſht of him, is true, and yet it is nothing in reſpect of what I ſee with my two Eyes: Wherefore I will never conſent to his being thus outrag'd by theſe Villains, but will help him to my power, tho' I am ſure he hates me more than any man living. And nevertheleſs, I think my ſelf happy, that I am come in time to let him know, that (ſetting hatred aſide) I am more a Lover of Vertue than Enmity: It being a more commendable thing to vanquiſh ones ſelf, than all others. Therefore my Companion, I beſeech you, let us chaſtiſe theſe Traitors: For Knight-hood is principally ordain'd for ſuch occaſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then they went upon the Sand, and Embracing their Shields, fiercely Aſſailed thoſe, who held the King thus beſieged, the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> crying: <hi>Be gone, Villains, be gone you ſhall all dye for having thus laid hands on the beſt King in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And at the ſame time, he gave ſuch a Blow with his Sword, to the firſt he met, that he cleft his Iron Cap, and his Head, even to the Shoulders. Then thruſting himſelf into the Croud, he ſtruck on the right and left with ſuch force, that whom he firmly hit, had no need of a Chirurgion. <hi>Gradamart</hi> on the other ſide, did not much leſs, as, who was of a Giantly Rare, an hardy and valiant Knight, and he would gladly let King <hi>Amadis</hi> know, that for ſake of <hi>Liſvart</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> with whom his Siſter was ſo much in Love, he willingly employ'd his Perſon in his Service.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Amadis</hi> was at that time very much wounded, nevertheleſs, finding himſelf aſſiſted, and by ſuch gallant men, had his Heart ſo rais'd, that he recover'd new ſtrength, and ſmote <hi>Maſcaron</hi> ſo home, that he ſeparated his head from his ſhoulders, crying with a loud voice: <hi>This day, Traitor, thy Life and thy great Diſloyalties ſhall come to an end together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Gradamart</hi> was fighting with the other Giant, who perceiving his Coſin <hi>Maſcaron</hi> in ſo piteous a condition, began to loſe heart, and recoile bark, ſtep by ſtep, that he might eſcape being kill'd: but the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> finding him in his way, gave him ſo great a blow on the Shoulder, that he cut off his right Arm in ſuch manner, as one might ſee his Liver, whereon he fell imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately dead. The reſt of the Aſſailants were ſo terrify'd at this, that they betook themſelves to their heels flying as faſt as they could towards the Fortreſs. Which profited them little, for at laſt they loſt their Lives, ſome few being excepted, who yielded to Mercy.</p>
               <p>Then the Gianteſs <hi>Malfadea,</hi> knowing the Victory to be turn'd in her favour, &amp; ſeeing the Head of her Enemy on the Field, ran to take it, and began to tear it with
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:154293:73"/> her Teeth, as the hungry Woolf does the tender Lamb, that he has ſtoln from the Shepherd: At which the King began to laugh, ſaying, he never thought, there could have been ſo great an Heart in a Womans Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwer'd the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword, ſhe will compleat her Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and ſhew by effect, that ſuch Conſtraints are often familiar to her, and ſuch, as ſhe.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwer'd the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword, it will pleaſe you to give us leave, becauſe we can make no longer ſtay with you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ah! ah, my Friends!</hi> ſaid the King, embracing them, <hi>Will you leave me then ſo ſoon, without telling me your Names? By all, that I hold of GOD, it will be a very great Diſpleaſure to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwer'd the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword, to obey you, you ſhall ſee us bare-fac'd, tho' you will know as little, as before: Nor did I think to do you ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in this place; but our Minds change with the time, and the gods often diſpoſe, quite otherwiſe, than Men propoſe.

               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Amdais,</hi> who, during theſe Diſcourſes, beheld them attentively, had his Heart wholly mov'd; For he began to think his Grand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on <hi>Liſvart,</hi> whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, and ſuſpected immediately by the Marks, which had been given him, that 'twas undoubtedly he, who had conquer'd the <hi>Defended Mountain,</hi> and fought in his Preſence with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Knight: Wherefore having more Deſire to know the Truth, he ſaid to him: <hi>Knight, I heartily thank you for the Benefit, I have receiv'd by you, and the more, becauſe the Enmity, which you ſay, you bare me, did not divert you from doing ſo good an Act. As for me, if you are he, whom I imagine, and whom I have hated more than all the men in the world, I will now ſwear to you, that for the Eſteem, I have of your Perſon, the Ill Will is wholly forgotten on my Side, which you ſhall ſee by experience, when you pleaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> Anſwer'd the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword, I know not, whether I am he, whom you preſume, but I ſhould think my ſelf very happy to be the Friend and Servant of ſo good a Prince, as your Majeſty; for Teſtimony whereof, and in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that we will continue yours, you ſhall preſently know, who we are, and ſome News, which will give you yet more Deſire to wiſh us well.

The News, I have to tell you, is, that your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:154293:73"/> Perion <hi>of</hi> Gaul <hi>and</hi> Liſvart <hi>of</hi> Greece <hi>are hard by with the Emperor of</hi> Trebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſond, <hi>where we left them in a Ship, near which you paſs'd laſt night: and we came after you, thinking by the Moans of this Damſel, that you carry'd her away by force againſt her Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King, who thought his Children dead, hearing, that they were in good health and ſo near him, was ſurpriz'd with ſuch extream Pleaſure, that lifting up his lands to Heaven, he caſt himſelf on his knees, and cry'd out: <hi>O Soveraign God! how great and admirable are your Judgments! and what aſſiſtance do you ſend thoſe, who unfeignedly call on you, to the end your ineffable Greatneſs may be known in all places! I give you Praiſe, O Lord all poſſible Praiſe and Thanks: For 'tis not long ſince I thought my ſelf at the end of my life, and having deliver'd me from death by the hand of him, I hated moſt in the world, have alſo by the ſame Perſon immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly let me know the beſt News that can befall me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he aroſe up again, ſtretching forth his Arms, went to embrace the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> ſaying to him: <hi>Ah! my Child, certainly I cannot call you otherwiſe ſeeing Reaſon obliges me to love and eſteem you more than any Knight living, I beſeech you to pardon me the little Reception, I have hitherto given you: For your Vertue deſerves well, that you be honor'd amongſt all the worthy men, I know.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwer' the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword, I my ſelf will be the Meſſenger of ſuch good News, and will bring them more eaſily than thoſe whom you will ſend.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> and <hi>Gradamart,</hi> ſailing on the Sea, arriv'd by Fortune in the Iſle of the <hi>Vermilion Tower,</hi> where <hi>Gandalfe</hi> was combated, and defeated and <hi>Galeotes</hi> and <hi>Madafima,</hi> the Father and Mother of <hi>Balan,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd out of Priſon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFter the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> and <hi>Gradamart,</hi> had taken leave of King <hi>Amadis,</hi> and were return'd to Sea, they commanded their Mariners to ſteer their Courſe to the Place, where they had left their Company: And this they did, hoping to be quickly there, and relate to them, what they knew of King <hi>Amadis</hi> who expected them, as you have been told. But no more finding either the Ship, or any Man, of whom they might enquire, what was become of it, the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> was ready to dye for diſpleaſure, tho' <hi>Gradamart</hi> comforted him as much, as poſſibly he could, knowing, whence this his Diſcontent proceeded. They reſolv'd then, as haſt, to return to King <hi>Amadis,</hi> and take their way together to Great <hi>Britain,</hi> where perhaps they might have News of what they ſo much deſir'd: <hi>For,</hi> ſaid <hi>Gradamart, 'twould be difficult for ſuch Perſons, as the Emperor, and the King of</hi> Sicily, <hi>to be long conceal'd, without being diſcover'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this cauſe they acquainted the Seamen with their Intention, who, reſitting their Veſſel began to Sail with a favourable Wind, which laſted but a little while, for there aroſe ſuddainly ſuch a Tempeſt, that they were often in Danger of being Caſt away, and were ſorc'd to abandon their Sails and Oars to the good Pleaſure of Fortune, which drove them four whole days without ſight of Land, or of any thing, that might give them the leaſt hopes in the World to Eſcape. But on the fifth mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Bark came to the ſhore of an Iſland, into which they made a Deſcent, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thanks to their gods for this Relief, tho' they knew not the Countrey, where they perceiv'd, not far from them, a Caſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> built of ſtone, as red as Blood, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> call'd to mind, that <hi>Balan</hi> hear ſuch an one for his Device: wherefore he ſaid to <hi>Gradamart:</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Never truſt me, dear Friend, if we are not arriv'd in the</hi> Iſland of the Vermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion Tower, <hi>and if this Place is not the Caſtle, where the Father and Mother of</hi> Balan <hi>are detain'd Priſoners, which greatly moves me to go ſee</hi> Gandalfe, <hi>and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him for courteſy to deliver them, and the Land alſo to whom it belongs</hi>

               <p>And as they were thus Diſcourſing, they ſaw come towards them, an Eſquire, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on a Nag, who, without ſaluting them, ſaid to them: <hi>Knights,</hi> Gandalfe, <hi>King of the</hi> Sagittary Iſland, <hi>greatly wonders, what has mov'd you to ſet Foot
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:154293:74"/> in this Countrey, which is his, without acquainting him, and ſends you word by me, that you come willingly to his Priſons, otherwiſe, he will put you to the cruelſt Death, he can imagine: however, if perhaps</hi> Balan, <hi>Son of</hi> Galeotes <hi>is one of you, he would have him underſtand, that he is very glad of it, not for any Good he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires him, but in hopes to take off his Head, and ſend it with his Fathers and</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balimas, <hi>to that wicked King</hi> Amadis, <hi>with whom he ſo braggingly threaten'd him. But he thinks, that the perſon, I ſpeak of, has no leiſure to return, for fear ſuch an Happineſs ſhould befall him, ſeeing 'tis ſo long, ſince he promis'd to come back and fight him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> was exceedingly mov'd at the hearing himſelf threatned with a Priſon, and angrily anſwer'd the Eſquire: <hi>Friend, return to thy Maſter, and tell him, that he ſhews himſelf, by thy Meſſage, a more fooliſh and proud King, than we are raſh, for having entred into the Countrey, which he ſhall ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſe; and where we know that he has nothing of right. Tell him alſo, that the coming of</hi> Balan <hi>will make him as ſorry, as he brags he ſhould be glad: And for to give him certain aſſurance of it, I am</hi> Balan, <hi>who could come no ſooner to fight him, not for any fear of him, but for want of Time and Opportunity convenient. And therefore let him perform to me, what he is oblig'd to, and I will likewiſe on my part keep my promiſe with him, which is to preſent his Head to King</hi> Amadis, <hi>a Prince more Vertuous and Debonnair, than he is Traitorous and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Eſquire, having heard him, began to ſhake his head and ſmiling, to ſay to him in mockery: <hi>In good ſaith I well know now, that your Brain is weaker, and more diſturb'd, than I thought for: Nevertheleſs, your being a Fool, is no Argument to hinder your being chaſtis'd as you deſerve. But ſtay, I am going to fetch one that will teach you henceforth to ſpeak more dutifully, and reſpectful, than you have done of the Perſon of ſuch a Prince as King</hi> Gandalfe <hi>my Maſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he turn'd his Bridle, and ſetting Spurs to his Horſe, went back the way he came, leaving <hi>Gradamart</hi> very much diſpleas'd, that the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> had alone granted him ſo great a Matter: For he knew by Report that <hi>Gandalfe</hi> was one of the cruelſt and ſtrongeſt Giants in the world, and for this cauſe he ſaid to his Companion: <hi>As GOD help me, ſince you concern your ſelf ſo much in the Affairs of others, you ought much more to take ſome care of your own, and I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how you have ſo lightly undertaken this Combat, without giving me ſome part in the Danger or Honour that may come of it: Since I much better reſemble</hi> Balan, <hi>both in Stature and Countenance than you do, and ſhould be pleas'd that</hi> Gandalfe <hi>ſhould think me ſo, and that you your ſelf would aſſert it to him. By your doing this I ſhall know that you are willing to recompence the Love I bear you: otherwiſe not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ah! my great Friend,</hi> anſwer'd the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword, the farther we go, the more (methinks) is our Mutual Love manifeſted, wherefore there is
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:154293:75"/> now no need to make any Proof of it: And as for the care, you ſay, I take of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Affairs, indeed they are not others, but our own; ſeeing you ſufficiently know the good Will that</hi> Balan <hi>bears us, which obliges us to defend, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns him, as it were our own. Yet will I not excuſe the wrong, I have done you in not asking your Counſel, before I anſwer'd the Eſquire: But the Indignation, he put me in by his Threats, and the high Words, he gave us, made me thus forget my ſelf, for which, I beſeech you to pardon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt, they were debating theſe matters, the Eſquire went to carry the King the Anſwer of the two Knights, at which he was like to run mad for ſpite. Then he haſtily d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>manded his Arms, and Arm'd himſelf, ordering his Servants to take eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial heed, that <hi>Balan</hi> did not fly: <hi>for,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I will have him burnt with thoſe I keep Priſoners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And immediately he commanded a great Fire to be kindled without the Caſtle, over againſt which he caus'd <hi>Galeotes</hi> and <hi>Madaſima</hi> to be bound. Now they knowing nothing of the Combat, which was to be fought, but thought they ſhould ſurely dye, when they perceiv'd the two Knights, that expected <hi>Gandalfe,</hi> who ſeeing theſe poor Captives in ſuch Miſery, having their Fleſh to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then came <hi>Gandalſe,</hi> to whom the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> addreſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſaying to him: <hi>King, 'tis juſt that before our fight, thou ſwear to me, that, if the Victory be on my ſide, none of thine ſhall do me any hurt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ah! wretched Creature?</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>doſt thou think to fall into this hazard? No, no, I will take care to keep thee from it: and to the end thou mayſt not doubt of it, I ſwear to thee by the great god</hi> Iupiter, <hi>that if I can poſſibly avoid it, I will not kill thee in this Combat, but will take thee alive, to give thee afterwards at leiſure a thouſand Deaths one after another. Therefore from this time look to thy ſelf.</hi>
               </p>

But to what purpoſe is it to deſcribe particularly all theſe Stratagems, and ſo many Blows? being finally both tir'd, and out of breath, they got up again, and, as if they had yet receiv'd no Dammage, began afreſh to aſſault each other with greater violence. In the mean time <hi>Gradamart</hi> approacht <hi>Galeotes</hi> and <hi>Madaſima,</hi> who were bound naked to a Poſt, as you have been told, and unty'd them, remonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them, that this Combat was undertaken for their Liberty, and that they ſhould therefore pray to GOD for the Victory of the good Knight: <hi>for beſides,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that your Affairs would go ill, if he ſhould miſcarry, 'twould be very great Dammage that he ſhould dye.</hi>

               <p>They, who had to this time been ignorant of the Occaſion of the Combat, lifted up their Hands to Heaven, and weeping bitterly, made devout Prayers and Oriſous. In the mean time the two Combatants, who us'd their utmoſt endeavours to defeat each other, were conſtrain'd again to take breath, and go back.

And paſſing on, they came to a croſs way, where they were joyn'd by a Lady, mounted on a very handſome Nag. She was cloth'd in black Silk, and had her Face ſo cover'd, that there was nothing but her Eyes to be ſeen, ſhe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd by ten Knights, compleatly Arm'd and four very fair Damſels. She ſaluted them courteouſly, and they return'd her ſalutation, asking her, whither ſhe was going?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lords,</hi> anſwer'd ſhe, <hi>we are going to ſee the Wonders done by a Knight, who keeps a Kay hard by, and whoſe Renown is ſuch, that I am come expreſly from my Countrey to ſee him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In truth,</hi> ſaid the Emperor, <hi>we will then accompany you thither: for ſome of ours deſire to try themſelves againſt him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In good time,</hi> anſwer'd the Lady, <hi>I am very glad of it, we ſhall ſee, whether 'tis true that is ſaid of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As they were diſcourſing thus, they went out of the Forreſt, and perceiv'd in the Plain, two Rich Tents, ſet up in a Grove of Elms, againſt one of which there were many Lances leaning, and under the ſhade was a Chair of State, in which was ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a very fair Damſel, and near her a Knight compleatly Arm'd, who ſeeing this
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:154293:77"/> Company approach, ſet her immediately on a ſtout Nag, which two Eſquires held by the Reins; which done, ſhe rid directly to the Emperor and his Company, and ſaid to them: <hi>Sirs, the Dutcheſs of</hi> Savoy, <hi>my Miſtreſs, ſends you word, if you reſolve to paſs the Kay, it muſt be on the ſame Conditions, that all others do:</hi> which ſhe declar'd to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Perion,</hi> who was the firſt to enter into play, took the word before all the reſt, and anſwer'd her: <hi>Damſel, we are come on no other occaſion, and therefore 'tis not needful to ſay any more of it: wherefore return to your Miſtreſs, and tell her, that we will keep the Law which is eſtabliſh'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So much the better,</hi> ſaid ſhe, and, ſuddenly turning her Horſe, went back.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Knight of the Kay, knowing that <hi>Perion</hi> was making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ready to Iuſt, charg'd a great Lance, and covering himſelf with his Shield, march'd ſlowly to meet him: but approaching the Career, they ran ſo ſtifly one againſt the other, that their Staves flew in ſhivers, themſelves meeting with Shields Bodies and Head, ſo that they both came to the Ground, and their Horſes under them. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they got up again, and putting their hands to their Swords, began to Aſſault each other ſo outragiouſly, that they well ſhew'd themſelves to be no Pren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices in that work. For this firſt Aſſault continued above two hours without their taking breath, or without its being known, who had the better or the worſe: and their Shields were ſo hack'd, and their Armor ſo endammaged, that not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt any longer the edge of their Swords, the pure blood was ſeen to trickle down from their Bodies to the Graſs.</p>
               <p>The Dutcheſs who piteouſly beheld her Knight, chang'd colour every moment, becauſe the longer <hi>Perion</hi> continu'd the more brisk and couragious he appear'd, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf ſo much dreaded by his Enemy, that he thought he never found any Man, except the <hi>Knight of the burning Sowrd,</hi> that put him ſo much to it: a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A devil certainly he is, though he has the ſhape of a Man: for if he had been other, he could not have treated me ſo rudely: wherefore, permit me not, O Lord, in five days, which remain to accompliſh my Oath in the keeping this Paſs, to fall into any ſhame, or danger of my body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Perion</hi> thought no leſs on his ſide: Nevertheleſs he would rather have choſe never to have been diſenchanted than to be ſo unhappily vanquiſht, and that in <hi>Great Britain:</hi> the thoughts of which ſo enrag'd him, that he redoubled his blows, whereof the Dutcheſſes Knight made little Account: nor could any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage be diſcern'd more on the one ſide than on the other, tho they were hath ſo dy'd with blood, that their Harneſs, before bright, was become red, which very much diſpleaſed <hi>Liſvart,</hi> who thought, 'twould be impoſſible, <hi>Perion</hi> ſhould not h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This, when the Dutcheſs ſaw, ſhe chang'd Colour, which was perceiv'd by her Knight, who, deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to recover his Reputation, and rejoyce her, who was almoſt dead at the ſight of his misfortune, flew at <hi>Perion</hi> giving him ſuch a blow on the Helmet, that, if it had not been one of the beſt in the world, his life had been infallibly gone.

But riſing nimbly up, he took his Sword in both hands, and was ready to give his Enemy the like, when the Damſel, whom they had met in the way, attended by ſo fair a Company, alighted from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Perion,</hi> much aſtoniſht at her Words, ſuddenly knew her to be the Dutcheſs of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who came to ſeek him in <hi>Trebiſond,</hi> to defend her Land, which he re-conquer'd for her, as you have been told in the ſixth Book of <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaul,</hi> whereat he then receiv'd great Ioy. And nevertheleſs, as if he had been in the Preſence of his Lady <hi>Gricileria,</hi> he could not forbear to bluſh, fearing ſhe would be diſcontented at it: But finding <hi>Florelus</hi> to be ſo good a Knight, that there was not known any Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them, he perſwaded himſelf, ſhe would eaſily forgive him this Fault, <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relus</hi> then underſtanding, by his Mothers Diſcourſe, that he was Son of <hi>Perion,</hi> was the joyfulleſt man in the world: ſhe had indeed formerly told him of it, but he had never ſeen him, and therefore reſolv'd as ſoon as his Enterpriſe was finiſht, to go and ſeek him where-ever he might be. Wherefore ſeeing himſelf deliver'd from this Travel; and the Offence, he had committed, he threw his Helmet on the Ground, and kneeling down to kiſs his Hands, ſaid to him with Tears in his Eyes: <hi>Alas! My Lord, pardon me this Fault, for which I am certainly very well chaſtis'd, tho' I eſteem my Wounds as nothing, and leſs the Reſiſtance, I have made againſt you: For if there is any Goodneſs in me, it proceeds from you, who are my Father.</hi>

                  <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſaid the Dutcheſs of <hi>Auſtria, never was woman more diſcontented, than I have been for a time: For he left me, and my Country, without taking leave of me, to go, as <hi>I</hi> have ſince underſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Madam,</hi> ſaid King <hi>Arban, it is then my opinion, that I go (if you pleaſe) to them to morrow, and intreat them in your Name to come to</hi> London: <hi>for I am ſure, the King would be much diſpleaſed, if the Emperor and the King of</hi> Sicily <hi>ſhould not be received, as the greatneſs of their Quality deſerves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I beſeech you do ſo,</hi> anſwer'd the Queen, <hi>and take with you ſuch perſons from hence, as you ſhall think good. Tell them from me, that the Kings Abſence ſhall not hinder me from giving them the beſt Reception I can, and recommend me affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately to their good Graces, eſpecially to the Queen of</hi> Sicily, <hi>and the Infanta her Daughter. Tell my Children alſo, that they by no means delay to come and ſee me, and bring all the reſt with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Arban</hi> then parted the next day, and with a good Company of Knights and Eſquires went to the Kay, where he found the Emperor with the reſt hearing Maſs, to whom he related the Queens Meſſage, inviting and requeſting them in the beſt manner he could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Certainly,</hi> ſaid the Emperor, <hi>we would in no wiſe fail ſo good a Princeſs; but I doubt our Sick Men will not be able to remove, they are ſo exceedingly wounded but let us go ſee them, and we ſhall know their Opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:154293:80"/>
               <p>Then they went into the Pavilion, where <hi>Perion</hi> and <hi>Florelus</hi> were. <hi>Perion,</hi> who preſently knew King <hi>Arban,</hi> ſtretching forth his Arms, embrac'd him, and ask'd him, whether the King and Queen were in good Health.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Lord,</hi> anſwered he, <hi>I can give you no account of the King, who is abſent; but the Queen deſires you and</hi> Liſvart <hi>to come and ſee her, as ſoon as poſſible you can, and to bring with you theſe Lords and Ladies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To day,</hi> ſaid <hi>Perion, it cannot be; but to morrow it may, and in the mean time I will cauſe a Litter to be made, to carry this wounded Knight and me. You will therefore return to her, with our Excuſes and Recommendations, to her good Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore King <hi>Arban,</hi> after he had diſcours'd ſome time with him, and taking leave of the Emperor, return'd back to <hi>London,</hi> where he acquainted the Queen with the Anſwer of theſe Lords, that they would be with her the next day at Dinner. And for this cauſe, ſhe commanded her richeſt Hangings to be put up, and her Palace to be adorn'd in the moſt Magnificent manner poſſible.</p>

                  <p>How the Emperor of <hi>Trebiſond,</hi> and his Company came to <hi>London,</hi> to viſit Queen <hi>Oriana:</hi> and of the Diſcourſe, they had together.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFter King <hi>Arban</hi> had left the Emperor and the reſt at the Kay, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> knowing that they were all to part for <hi>London</hi> gave Order for the making a Litter to carry <hi>Florelus</hi> and <hi>Perion.</hi> So they paſs'd the Remainder of that day in all pleaſure, and the next day every one of them took Horſe, except the two wounded Men, who were carry'd in Mens Arms, that they might not be too much ſhockt by the way. And behind them came the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> in a great Chariot, cover'd with Cloth of Gold. At her Neck hung the rich Sword and Shield, and round about her were the Shields of the vanquiſht Knights, and their Names underneath, for a Teſtimony of <hi>Florelus</hi>'s Victory, and Triumph, which ſo pleaſed <hi>Perion,</hi> that he ſent her his, praying her to put it in the rank with the others, or elſe he ſhould be diſpleaſed.</p>
               <p>She, who durſt not refuſe it, took it, and ſaid to the Eſquire, that brought it: <hi>My Friend, tell my Lord</hi> Perion, <hi>that I will obey him, ſince 'tis his pleaſure; but I will put it in the place, it deſerves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſhe askt for a Lance, to the Head of which ſhe caus'd the Shield to be faſtned, and raiſed it up to the top of the Chariot, ſending her own rich one, with the Sword, to hang at <hi>Perions</hi> Litter, who would not at firſt permit it, and in ſuch Equipage, they entred into the City of <hi>London,</hi> there going forth to meet them King <hi>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:154293:80"/> done them at their Entrance into the Town. The Emperor led the Queen of <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Olorius</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Infanta <hi>Lucella,</hi> and <hi>Liſvart Gradafilea,</hi> with which ſhe was more content, than if Great <hi>Britain</hi> it ſelf had faln to her by Succeſſion. <hi>Balan</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd the Dutcheſs of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> but he was ſo melancholly, that he thought on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but having his leave to go and fight King <hi>Gandalfe:</hi> and in ſuch order they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted at the Palace, where the King of <hi>Sicily</hi> took the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> under the Arms for the ſake of <hi>Florelus,</hi> whom he lov'd, and greatly eſteem'd from the day they try'd themſelves together, every one of the others led his, as you have been told.</p>
               <p>Then came the Queen <hi>Oriana,</hi> clad in black Cloth, for the Abſence of King <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> and at the Entrance of the Hall, gave them a very great and ſumptuous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. With her were ſo many fair Ladies, and Damſels, and ſo richly adorn'd, that they ſeemed rather Goddeſſes deſcended on the Earth, than Mortal Women. The Reverences then, Welcoms, Kiſſes, and Embraces on the one ſide and the other, being thus begun and ended, Queen <hi>Oriana</hi> addreſſed her ſelf to the Infanta <hi>Lucella,</hi> and ſaid to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam, as I have been given to underſtand, I have at this day by your Means my two Sons: You are more than welcome.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>During this Diſcourſe, <hi>Oriana</hi> took ſuch Delight in beholding the very great beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Lucella,</hi> that ſhe could not take her Eye from off her, when <hi>Liſvart</hi> came to pay her his Reſpects, preſenting to her <hi>Gradafilea,</hi> whom ſhe had formerly ſeen at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi> 'Twould be little to the purpoſe to acquaint you with the Diſcourſe they had together, let it ſuffice, that they were all highly ſatisfied with the good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and Honour, that was given them.

               </argument>
               <p>THis Noble Company being at Table, making the beſt Chear they could deviſe, except <hi>Balan,</hi> who thought on nothing but going to Fight his Enemy, and deliver his Father and Mother from the cruel Priſon, in which they were detain'd, there entred into the Hall a Damſel, carrying in her hands the Head of a Giant, which ſhe held by the hair. This Woman was ſoon known by <hi>Balan:</hi> for 'twas <hi>Macetta,</hi> to whom the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> had delivered King <hi>Gandalf</hi>'s Head, to preſent it to King <hi>Amadis.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Damſel,</hi> anſwered the Emperor, <hi>he is not here at this time, for which we are much troubled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It may well be,</hi> ſaid <hi>Macetta, that he is not yet arrived, but his return will not be much longer delayed: and in the mean time I pray you to ſhew me, which of theſe Ladies is Queen</hi> Oriana, <hi>to whom, in the Kings Abſence, I am commanded to addreſs my ſelf.</hi>

                  <hi>Madam,</hi> anſwered the Damſel, <hi>the</hi> Knight of the burning Sword, <hi>the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht of all men this day living, ſends you this Head of the King of the</hi> Sagit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Iſland, <hi>to acquit</hi> Balan, <hi>ſon of</hi> Galeotes, <hi>of the promiſe, he had made.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:154293:81"/> to the Juſt, who has ſo well abated the pride of the Tyrant, as you may ſee, and they are now at liberty, whom he has ſo long detained Priſoners, all which in great humility kiſs your hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This News indeed very much pleaſed all that heard it, who more and more prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Proweſs of the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> and amongſt the reſt <hi>Balan,</hi> who in his heart, beſought Almighty GOD, to give him an opportunity ſometimes to acknowledge to him the Favour, he had done him.</p>
               <p>Then the Queen anſwered <hi>Macetta: In good faith, Damſel, the King and I are bound to the good Knight, whom I heartily wiſh in this Company: for</hi> Balan <hi>is now delivered from the great pain, and his promiſe well performed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Damſel,</hi> ſaid the King of <hi>Sicily, can you tell me any thing of a Knight, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by force a Damſel, to follow whom the Knight you ſpeak of left our Veſſel.</hi>

                  <hi>Yes indeed Sir,</hi> anſwered ſhe, <hi>that Knight forced neither Lady nor Damſel, but went with her, you mention to fight a Traytor who had killed her Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

At her feet ſet two Damleſs, leaning their Heads on their left Arms, like Women, oppreſt with Grief: And by her ſide, were two black Knights, ſo weak, that they were even double with Age, and notwithſtanding arm'd with Arms of great Value.

               <p>Good Champion, GOD give you a favourable Adventure: Can you tell us any News of a Perſon, nam'd <hi>the Knight of the Burning Sword?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King in whom the Deſire of knowing, what they would have with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d more, anſwer'd:</hi> My Lords, he parted from me not many dayes ſince, and 'twould be difficult for me to tell you at this time, where he is, and more difficult, as I believe for you to find him. But foraſmuch as I greatly love and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem him, if you pleaſe to acquaint me with the Buſineſs, you have with him, I will
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:154293:83"/> endeavor to tell you farther, what I know of him. And if I can, there is nothing how grievous ſoever, that I will not in his ſtead undertake, to do him Pleaſure and Service.</p>
               <p>On this aſſurance, <hi>anſwer'd the old man,</hi> and alſo becauſe you ſeem to me a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant man, I will ſatisfy you. Underſtand, Sir Knight, that this Lady, whom you ſee lying here, is Queen of <hi>Saba,</hi> Wife to King <hi>Magadan,</hi> whoſe near Kinſmen we are. This King taking Pleaſure to make uſe of white Perſons, ſome of his gave him about ten or twelve years ſince a Child, call'd the <hi>Gentleman of the burning Sword,</hi> for the Repreſentation of a Sword, which he has naturally printed on his Stomach, red as blood, with certain white Characters, which have not yet been underſtood by any one, as we know of. The King did him ſo much Honor, as to breed him up with his Son <hi>Fulurtin,</hi> and gave them both Order of Knighthood, ſo that inſtead of <hi>Gentleman</hi> he is at this day nam'd the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> We are now ſeeking him, and to find him, are parted from <hi>Saba</hi> in the Equipage you ſee. And to the end you may the better underſtand the Affair, this <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> being yet in <hi>Saba</hi> a Gentleman, Son to one of the greateſt Princes of <hi>Morona,</hi> acquainted the King, that he, of whom I ſpeak, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Treaſon againſt his Majeſty abuſing the Queen <hi>Beruca,</hi> who is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, at which the King exceedingly diſpleas'd, thought to aſcertain this unworthy Act, by ſurprizing them together; but he was deceiv'd: For the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> was advertiz'd of it, and abſented himſelf, ſo that ſince we have had no News of him. And, for this cauſe the King commanded the Queen to be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and kept ſtrickly, till ſuch time as he had recover'd the Adulterer, to burn them in the ſame Fire. Nevertheleſs ſeeing, that this cruel ſentance had been already ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes delay'd, and that the other was no longer in his Countrey, he reſolv'd to put it in Execution againſt the Queen.</p>
               <p>But ſhe offered to prove her innocence by a Knight, who ſhould fight <hi>Maudan:</hi> For ſo was her Accuſer nam'd. To which the King would in no wiſe have given Ear, had not we, who are his Uncles, and many other princes of his Blood, mov'd with Compaſſion, perſwaded him to grant it: Which being come to <hi>Maudans</hi> knowledge he came with a great Bravado to remonſtrate, that he would not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Aſſertion, but would bring a Coufin of his, that ſhould maintain it to the Death, and that they two together would enter the Field againſt two others, ſuch as the Queen could find. And having ſo ſaid, he threw down his pledge, but, tho' the Queen has many great kindred, yet none advanc'd to take it up, not for any doubt of her Innocence, but for the great Proweſs, that is ſaid to be in the two Aſſailants. Then was Prince <hi>Fulurtin</hi> ſo ſorry, that he took up the pledge and Offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone to fight in perſon for the Juſtification of his Mother. Which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, ſaying, that they would never put hand to Sword againſt the only Son of their Soveraign Lord. Thus was the good Lady, diſtitute in a manner of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:154293:83"/> imploring with join'd hands the Kings Mercy, with ſix months time, to ſeek ſome ſtranger, that would defend her, ſince there was not any one in <hi>Saba</hi> and <hi>Morana,</hi> that offer'd himſelf. And tho' <hi>Magadan</hi> at firſt ſeem'd deaf, yet impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd by us two, he in fine granted her Requeſt, on condition we ſhould accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny her whither ſhe would have us, and at ſix months end on pain of Death bring her back again. Which we ſolemnly ſware to do.</p>
               <p>Then we caus'd this Ship to be equipp'd, and from the <hi>Nile</hi> entred into this Sea, where we have been already above theſe twelve weeks, enquiring with great Diligence for the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> in whom lies all the Queens hopes: Becauſe he alone knows better, how this Affair goes, than all other men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. And this good Lady, well knowing his great Courage, makes no doubt, but aſſoon as he ſhall have News of it; he will leave all things to defend this Quarrel. Now have you at length underſtood the Occaſion of our Voyage: therefore we affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionately deſire you, if you know any Remedy to teach it us: Otherwiſe if the gods provide not for it, this good Lady is in very great danger, both of her Honor and Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>During the Diſcourſe the Queen ſo wept and lamented, that the hardeſt Heart in the world would have been touch'd with Compaſſion, and it fell into King</hi> Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis<hi>'s Mind, that ſhe was really innocent: Which made him ſuddenly think, that he had a very good occaſion to requite the</hi> Knight of the burning Sword <hi>for the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he had receiv'd of him in the great</hi> Siclades, <hi>and for this cauſe he ſaid to the old Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Queen will ſwear to me on her ſoul, that ſhe is falſly accus'd by <hi>Maudan,</hi> I will go with you, and fight him: For perhaps you will not in ten years find him, whom you ſeek, and in the mean time her Affairs would go very ill.</p>
               <p>Ah! ah! Sir Knight <hi>anſwer'd the Queen:</hi> I ſwear to you by the high Name of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> that we never ſo much as thought of the Diſloyalty, with which we are charg'd.</p>
               <p>Madam, <hi>ſaid</hi> Amadis I believe your Word, have therefore good hopes in GOD: For he is juſt, and will do you Juſtice, if you are juſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then were the two old Knights very joyful for having thus ſhortned their Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and ſo fitly found a Knight, that would fight</hi> Maudan, <hi>and maintain the Queens Right who very affectionatly thanking him, as did alſo her two Vncles, beſought him to come into their Ship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will do it <hi>anſwer'd he</hi> on the Proteſtation, you all three make me, that the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers Quarrel is falſe: 'tis alſo very requiſit, that you have more hopes in your good Right, than in my ſtrength; Otherwiſe thinking to preſerve you, Madam, <hi>ſaid he to the Queen,</hi> I ſhould ruin you, and my ſelf alſo.</p>
               <p>Alas, Sir Knight, <hi>ſaid ſhe:</hi> I beſeech you to believe that knowing the good Will, you have to defend me, if my Cauſe were in the leaſt dubious, I would not hazard your life for the Preſervation of mine own, which is already ſo troubleſome to me, that I eſteem it leſs than nothing.</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:154293:84"/>
               <p>And in this belief <hi>anſwer'd</hi> Amadis, I will take the Charge of it: And deſire you not to wonder at what I have remonſtrated to you, ſeeing every Knight who enters into the Field of Battle, greatly fails, if he goes not with aſſurance, that the Right is on his ſide.</p>
               <p>That I ſwear to you again, <hi>ſaid the Queen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis ſufficient <hi>anſwer'd</hi> Amadis, let us go when you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then he went into the Ship, and diſcharging his Bark, chang'd his Name, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to be call'd the</hi> Vermilion Knight, <hi>becauſe his Arms were all red, being thoſe which</hi> Alquif <hi>ſent him, when he embarkt after his Diſenchantment, to go to the Siege of</hi> Conſtantinople. <hi>Thus thoſe of</hi> Saba <hi>return'd back, diſcourſing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the moſt agreeable Matters, they could, till they entred into the Mouth of the</hi> Nile, <hi>along which they ſail'd, and went aſhore at</hi> Terrodin; <hi>where the Queen ſaid to</hi> Amadis,</p>
               <p>Good <hi>Vermilion Knight,</hi> we are now in the Country, where <hi>I</hi> hope in our gods, in you, and in the good Right I have, that you will make the wicked, who accuſe me, acknowledge their Treaſon: For 'tis not above a dayes Journey from hence <hi>to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> where we ſhall find the Court.</p>
               <p>So much the better Madam, <hi>anſwer'd he.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the Citizens were incontinently advertiz'd of their Princeſs Return, and the Aid, ſhe brought with her: Wherefore they went to receive her, and do her Honor: For ſhe was greatly lov'd of them all for her Vertues. And for this Cauſe they preſented her Horſes, and what was neceſſary for her going to the King. Before whom, aſſoon as they were come into</hi> Saba, <hi>his two old Vncles preſented</hi> Buruca, <hi>and the ſtrange Knight.</hi> Magadan, <hi>&amp; the Lords of his Court wondring at the Queens ſo ſudden Return, and yet more at him, who would fight the two Knights, that accus'd her, began to caſt their Eyes on</hi> Maudan, <hi>to ſee, what Countenance he kept, when</hi> Buruca <hi>brake forth into this following Diſcourſe to the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, to ſhew you, that the Traytor, whom <hi>I</hi> ſee here preſent, has unjuſtly, falſly, and diſloyally accus'd me of Adultery, <hi>I</hi> preſent you this Knight, who, if i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y, that my innocency ſhall be verify'd, and the wicked Accuſer puniſht according to his Deſert.</p>
               <p>Madam, <hi>anſwer'd the King,</hi> if your Knight does ſo much for you, you will be exceedingly oblig'd to him. Let him come forward then, and declare with his own Mouth, what he has undertaken.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Magadan, ſaid</hi> Amadis then, becauſe I have underſtood, that the Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is brought againſt this Noble Lady, was invented with the greateſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in the world, I am ready to fight the Traytors, to and prove againſt them, by force of Arms, that they have falſly, and maliciouſly accus'd her, and that in all the Evil, they have ſaid of her, and the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> they have ly'd in their Throats.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No ſooner had he finiſht this Diſcourſe, but</hi> Maudan <hi>ſtept forward, and holding his Coſin by the Hand, anſwered with great Boldneſs:</hi> By my Head, poor Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:154293:84"/> thou art mightily deceiv'd, thinking thus to ſave the Queen, who deſerves to be burnt, that ſhe may ſerve for an Example, not only to the noble Ladies of <hi>Saba,</hi> but to thoſe of the whole Earth: For 'tis certain, and we will maintain it, that ſhe has offended againſt the King by the Adultery, which the Wretch, who is fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, and ſhe have committed together. And becauſe thou art ſo forward, I tell thee, that thou thy ſelf ly'ſt, and that you both deſerve the Fire, or elſe to be drawn by four Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thro' the ſtreet of this Town.</p>
               <p>Ah Villain, <hi>anſwer'd he in the red Arms,</hi> if thou knoweſt as well how to fight, as to rail, thou muſt be a brave Fellow: Nevertheleſs one thing perſwades me, that thou art no ſuch, ſince to ſecond thee in ſo wicked an Act, thou tak'ſt as honeſt a man as thy ſelf. Thus are you both nothing worth, and againſt both will I maintain the words, I have ſpoken before the King's Majeſty, and ſo many Lords here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and here is my Pledge to defend it in open Combat, and that preſently, if it pleaſe the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then he ſtretcht forth the fore-part of his Armor; which</hi> Maudan <hi>took hold of, and pull'd ſo roughly to him, that King</hi> Amadis <hi>was ready to fall, at which he was ſo diſpleas'd, that putting his hand to his Sword, he was about to draw, had not the Conſideration of the Place, where he was, with held him, as alſo that King</hi> Magadan <hi>concern'd himſelf in it. And knowing, the wrong and injury, the other had done him, ſpake this to</hi> Maudan <hi>in great Wrath:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How now? Is it fit for you to be ſo preſumptuous in my Preſence? By all our gods, if I take you in hand, I will make you repent it: Be gone, and never offer to conteſt ſo much any more in my ſight. Let the Combat be to morrow as this ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger has requeſted, to whom I ſwear on the Faith and Word of a King, I will cauſe ſuch exact Juſtice to be done, that he ſhall have no Cauſe to complain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then he roſe up and went very angrily into the Chamber with</hi> Fulurtin, <hi>and the others, that were moſt intimate with him: In the mean time</hi> Maudan <hi>and his Coſin returned home, the</hi> Vermillion Knight <hi>alſo retiring himſelf in the Company of thoſe, who had brought him, with great Honour and good Entertainment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the Time appointed for the Combat.</hi>

And to conduct him to the Field, there came <hi>Seniel,</hi> one of the Iudges, whom King <hi>Magadan</hi> ſent thither, accompanyed by five Hundred Knights.

So ſhe had on the Crown and Diadem, according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of <hi>Saba,</hi> which ſo augmented her Champions Courage, that he thought long, till the Heralds gave notice for the beginning of the Combat. Which was done ſoon after, for by the Command of <hi>Magadan, Maudan</hi> and <hi>Azaruc</hi> being on the one ſide, accompany'd with two Counts their Kinſmen, who ſerv'd them for Sureties, and the <hi>Vermilion Knight</hi> on the other, between the two old men, who had brought him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; a King of Arms made Proclamation aloud, that none ſhould be ſo daring, or preſumptuous, for any Good, or Evil, that might befal the Combatants to give them any ſign, by any Look, Word, or otherwiſe, either to incite, or diſcourage them: And this on pain of Death. Then he cry'd out with a loud voice three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times in theſe following words: <hi>Let the good Combatants go and do their Duty.</hi>

                  <hi>Raſcal,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>if there were any hopes of Amendment in thee, I would do it: But thou being a Traitor as thou art, 'twould be a wrong to ſhew thee Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir you may ſee in me, how Fortune triumphs over ſuch wicked perſons, as I am: Nor has it indeed been ever known, but one ſin draws on another, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond many more, till at length they ſo blind thoſe, who commit them, that, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go the high way, they fall into the Ditch, which themſelves have digg'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whence they cannot afterwards get out.

               <p>The King, who was then beſieg'd with a great Remorſe of Conſcience, rais'd her up, kiſſing her with Tears in his Eyes, anſwered her: <hi>Madam, I well know, that I cannot indeed excuſe my Offence, for which I beſeech you to pardon me and to forget it, ſwearing to you by my Crown, that I will ſatisfy you and yours for it, as you ſhall think fit.</hi>

               <p>King <hi>Amadis</hi> very humbly thankt him: And becauſe the King thought he was much wounded, he gave his Son <hi>Fulurtin</hi> to bear him Company, and conduct him into one of the beſt Chambers of the Palace, where he diſarm'd himſelf. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' he was old, as you may well believe, yet did the Water, with which <hi>Urganda</hi> waſht him in the Caſtle of <hi>Apolidon,</hi> keep him ſo freſh, that he ſeem'd not to be above fourty: And he ſo much reſembled the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> that <hi>Fulurtin</hi> could not forbear having his Eye on him, who was ſo like the Perſon, whoſe Abſence he hourly more and more regretted. <hi>Amadis</hi> then being diſarm'd, &amp; without any wound, conſtraining him to keep his Chamber, return'd into the Hall with the Kings Son. And becauſe the Table was cover'd for Dinner, <hi>Magadan</hi> made him waſh with him and ſit down by the Queen, who very inſtantly pray'd him to tell, what he knew of the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword.</hi> Which he obey'd: And all thoſe, who heard his great Proweſs, exceedingly wondered, ſo that <hi>Fulurtin</hi> took a Reſolution to go and ſeek him. Then Dinner being over, <hi>Amadis</hi> who thought it long, till he ſaw Queen <hi>Oriana</hi> knowing the Trouble, ſhe was in for his Abſence, reſolv'd to requeſt the King to give him a Veſſel, fit for his Return to the Place, where Queen <hi>Buruca</hi> had found him. And tho' he with great Earneſtneſs urg'd his Diſmiſſion, yet could he not obtain it till four dayes after, during which he was greatly feaſted. And in the mean time a Ship was equipp'd for him, in which <hi>Fulurtin</hi> thought alſo to embark, and go ſeek his Companion; but the King would not at that time permit him. And for this cauſe he beſought <hi>Amadis</hi> to leave him his red Armor, which he would wear for his ſake, and in remembrance of the beſt Knight in the World. <hi>Amadis</hi> refus'd him not, and <hi>Fulurtin</hi> gave him another Suit, all white, and much richer. Then with his leave he put forth into the <hi>Nile,</hi> and from thence into the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, by a Wind fit for his Return into the Weſt, whence he came.</p>

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:154293:87"/> moſt part of which were come expreſly to ſee <hi>Eſclariana,</hi> Daughter to Prince <hi>Dener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> and <hi>Briſena,</hi> the Fame of whoſe Beauty and Gracefulneſs flew into all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, wholly in a manner reſembling the Excellence that was heretofore in her Grandmother Queen <hi>Oriana.</hi> Which coming to the Ears of <hi>Acayus,</hi> Prince of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> he would be of the Party, hoping to ask her of the Emperor for his Wife. And for this cauſe he parted from his Country, &amp; with a fair and great Train came to <hi>Mentz:</hi> Where <hi>Arquiſil</hi> receiv'd him courteouſly and honorably, as well for the ſake of his Father the King of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> as becauſe he was a fair, young, and good-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition'd Prince. <hi>Acayus</hi> was greatly pleas'd with it, and much more, when he had ſeen and diſcourſed with <hi>Eſclariana.</hi> Whom he found means to acquaint with the occaſion of his Arrival at Court, promiſing her, if ſhe thought good, to requeſt the Emperor's, and the King of <hi>Theſſaly</hi>'s Conſent to the Marriage of him and her. The Infanta, not us'd to ſuch Diſcourſes, bluſht at firſt, thanking him nevertheleſs for the Honor, he did her, and as a diſcreet, and well advis'd Lady, excus'd her ſelf from making any further Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Now there hapned to be preſent, when <hi>Acayus</hi> and <hi>Eſclariana</hi> were diſcourſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, another young Prince, nam'd <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>Buillon,</hi> who, pretending to the ſame Happineſs, <hi>Acayus</hi> did, felt in his Soul a great Diſturbance at the good looks, they gave each other, and thence entred into ſuch a Iealouſy, that it produc'd afterwards a great deal of Miſchief, as you ſhall underſtand. This Son to the Duke of <hi>Buillon</hi> was a young, luſty, and good Knight, as one ſhall ſee, but <hi>Eſclariana</hi> knowing, that he came from a Race of Traytors, made no Account of him, what Love and Service ſoever he offered her, or ſhe took notice of: So that ſhe would not, to be Empreſs of the whole world, have had him for her Husband. And what incenſed him more was, that he had found Means to underſtand part of the Offers which <hi>Acayus</hi> had made the Princeſs at which he was ſo inflam'd, that he reſolv'd to be revenged of his Corrival, and by killing him to get wholly rid of him. And what, much contributed thereto: Vnderſtand, that the Emperor had, on occaſion of ſo great a Court, caus'd Liſts to be ſet up for turneying, and Scaffolds round about: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Acayus</hi> put himſelf in the beſt Equipage, he could, hoping in ſavour of his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, to Do feats of Arms, and ſhew himſelf ſuch, as he was. And to the end, ſhe might the better know him, one day amongſt others he came to the Palace, where the Tables were cover'd for Dinner. Great and ſumptuous was the Service, during which <hi>Acayus</hi> could not be ſatisfyed with having his Eye continually on her, whom he loved with all his heart. And tho' ſhe minded it not, as being young, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the like Diſtemper, yet was <hi>Manaſſes</hi> ſtrangely uneaſy, and at every turn gnawed his Nails, till the Tables were taken away, and the Knights and Ladies went into the Court, where they found their Horſes ready to go &amp; ſee, who could ride beſt that Afternoon. Now <hi>Acayus</hi> ſtirred not from <hi>Eſclariana,</hi> but took the Reins of her Horſe, and led her, diſcourſing her, as thoſe are wont to do, who deſire their Miſtreſſes Favors. At which <hi>Manaſſes</hi> grew more enraged, but not being able at that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:154293:88"/> time to remedy it, he conſidered to prejudice them both to put himſelf by their ſide, and hear them, or keep them from ſpeaking privatly to one another. And neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Acayus,</hi> who doubted nothing, ceaſed not to proſecute his Affair, ſo that he ſaid to the Infants.</p>

                  <hi>Acayus,</hi> whoſe Head and Anger had heated, was ſo diſpleaſed, that he thus anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer'd <hi>Manaſſes.

               </p>
               <p>Then he gave him ſuch a Blow on the Head, as kill'd him, ſo that he fell dead from his Horſe to the Ground, at which there was a great Commotion: For the Princes Attendants, ſeeing ſuch an Outrage ran upon <hi>Manaſſes;</hi> but he was defended by his, ſo that many on both ſides there ended their Dayes: And yet worſe had it been, had not the Emperor taken order, who putting himſelf between the two Parties, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded both on their Lives to retire.

                  <hi>Gentlemen, and Kinſmen,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I am of Opinion, that, to attain to my purpoſe, one of you ſhall go to the Emperor, and preſent him with my moſt humble duty, aſſuring him, that the Juſtice he has Executed on my ſon, is well pleaſing to me, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Injury he had done his Majeſty by killing the Prince of</hi> Theſſaly <hi>ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, and that in his Majeſties preſence. And that, although Paternal Love cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in me ſome Regret, yet, when I think on the Equity, which, as a good Prince, and as a juſt Emperor, he has uſed, I find my ſelf ſo comforted, that I not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his Juſtice, as being exemplary to all, but moreover humbly thank him for having eaſed me from being ſevere to my own Fleſh. Which 'twas expedient I ſhould have been, deſiring to preſerve my Integrity, and the Honour of my houſe. Theſe, my Friends, are the Artifices, we muſt make uſe of, to attain to our deſires, to which he giving Credit, will properly reſemble the Raven, that held the Cheeſe, whom the Fox allured to ſing, that he might make him let go his Prey. For by this means he will have aſſurance of us and we may go and take him even in his Neſt, and at our pleaſure ſeiſe on him and his, letting not any one eſcape, that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict my coming to the Empire, to which I ſhall at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Certainly this damnable Counſel and Advice had ſo much force, that none of the Aſſiſtants contradicted it, but approved it, and commended it, chooſing immediately for the Bearer of that Meſſage <hi>Madaran,</hi> a Couſin of the Dukes, and as honeſt a Man as himſelf: who parted from them, and being come to the Emperor knew ſo fitly to palliate his Meſſage and Treaſon, that the good Prince believed more, than he ſhould have done, ſaying before all, that the Duke of <hi>Buiiion</hi> was indeed one of the diſcreeteſt Knights in the World, and who beſt deſerved the Government of a Monarchy. He gave therefore great Preſents to the Meſſenger, commanding him to tell his Maſter, that he deſired him to come to his Court, where he would honour him as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madaran,</hi> glad of ſuch Aſſurance, returned to the Duke, who expected him with a great part of his Allies, that kept themſelves in a readineſs according to the News, they ſhould have of their Meſſenger, who entirely related to them the Emperors diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. And for this cauſe they removed the Night following, going ſtrait towards <hi>Mentz.</hi> And they aſſembled the moſt ſecretly they could, above a thouſand, who lay conceal'd all the day in a Forreſt, near the City, into which about Evening they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred without being diſcovered. The Empe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

At which the Emperor, much affrighted, endeavoured to get away, but <hi>Madaran</hi> ſtept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and ſtriking him on the head, ſaid: <hi>Stay Emperor, ſtay: and remember the Injury thou haſt done the houſe of</hi> Buillon.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:154293:89"/>
               <p>The blow was Mortal, and the good Prince fell dead in the place. Which <hi>Diner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> ſeeing, he entred into ſuch Fury, that, diſarmed as he was, he flew at the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer Arm'd, ſtriking him ſo firmly, that he cleaved him to the very brains. Then the buſtle grew hot: for many Gallant Men, who were there preſent, wrapt their Cloaks about their Arms, and with their naked Swords a long time reſiſted the Traytors. Now <hi>Dinerpius</hi> knew that he could not avoid preſent death: wherefore he reſolved to ſell his Life dear, ſo that he met not any Man but he fell without ſpeaking a word more, notwithſtanding by misfortune one of the Traytors got be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, and wounded him through the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ah!</hi> ſaid <hi>Dinerpius, Villain thou haſt ſlain me:</hi> And turning about ſeparated his ſhoulder from the reſt of his body. Then they both ſell at the Feet of the Duke, who fearing leſt <hi>Dinerpius</hi> ſhould get up again, cut off his head.</p>
               <p>Thus the one Aſſailing, and the others defending, <hi>Briſenna</hi> and <hi>Eſclariana,</hi> who were in there Chambers heard the noiſe, and ſent ſuddainly a Damſel to know what the matter might be: but as ſoon as ſhe came into the Hall, ſhe perceived the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror dead, and the Empreſs in a Swound on the body. At which being greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, ſhe returned to the Ladies, to whom ſhe ſaid, ſighing and weeping: <hi>Alas, alas, Ladies! Would you know the matter? The wicked Duke of</hi> Buillon <hi>has murdered the Emperor, and all thoſe that accompanyed him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this cry the Princeſs <hi>Briſenna</hi> found no better remedy than to take her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and flying under the Vaults of the Palace, came to a Sally-port on the ſide of the River, where they perceived a Fiſher-boat, into which they entred: and ſetting it a drift, the Stream began to carry it down with ſo much ſwiftneſs, that they came to the Sea before it was day. In the mean time thoſe who lay concealed in the Dukes Houſe, and who only waited for the Slaughter, ran forth ſtrait into the Market-place, killing and wounding all they met. There was a pittiful and horrid Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: for theſe wicked Men often ſpared not the poor Women, who with their Hair about their Ears lamented, one for her Husband, another her Father or her Brother. And nevertheleſs the Fury of the Traytors did not decreaſe till it was day, and the Duke commanded every one ſhould endeavour to find out the Princeſs <hi>Briſenna,</hi> and her daughter <hi>Eſclariana:</hi> for he had the Empreſs and all her damſels in ſafe cuſtody. Then was ſearch made in every place: and nevertheleſs they could have no News of them. At which the Duke being exceedingly vext, cauſed it to be publiſht by ſound of Trumpet, that they ſhould be brought forth on p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But 'twas in vain, the Good Ladies were out of his power, and of the Mercy of GOD and the Waves.

               <p>Then he went about to throw her down, and proſecute his beaſtly Intent: But ſhe taught hold of his Hair, and crying out with a loud voice, begged the Aſſiſtance of Almighty GOD, who graciouſly and mercifully heard her: So that at that very Inſtant there paſſed by a Boat, and one Mariner, carrying a Knight, who, hearing this Voice, immediately commanded his Guide to make towards it with his Boat, that he might ſee, what the Matter was. Which he obeyed with great diligence. And though the Sea was covered with Miſts, yet he got ſo near the Skiff, that they ſaw the Villian holding the Damſel under him, who endeavoured with all her might to get out of his hands, with a loud voice lamenting her Misfortune.</p>
               <p>At which the Knight of the Boat being diſpleaſed, he cryed out to the other: <hi>Ah! Traytor, leave the Damſel: now curſed of GOD be ſuch Wretches as you, who will uſe force.</hi>

               <p>When ſhe, who was in a manner out of Breath, heard him ſpeak, you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin how much ſhe was rejoyced, and imploring his Aid, ſhe ſaid to him: <hi>Alas, my Lord, help me againſt this Traytor, who will diſhonour me.</hi>

               <p>At this gracious word the black Knight found himſelf unſpeakably eaſed, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both his knees to the ground, anſwered her: <hi>Pardon me, Madam, if I have not at firſt ſhewn you the Reſpect I ought: for your excellent Beauty ſo alienated the ſoundeſt Parts both of my Heart and Spirit, that I found my ſelf in an inſtant free, and immediately a Captive wounded with ſo mortal a Wo nd, that no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy can do it good, but your gracious Favour, which I beſeech you to grant me, telling me your Name, and what Adventure brought you hither, that I may ſerve you as you ſhall command me.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>When the black Knight heard ſhe would go into Great <hi>Britain,</hi> he had a more deſire to know her than before; nevertheleſs fearing to diſpleaſe her, he would not importune her any farther, but anſwered her thus: <hi>Madam, I am ſo much yours, that I will not diſobey you in any thing, but will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you into Great</hi> Britain, <hi>or elſewhere, as you ſhall think good My Name, ſince you deſire to know it, is, the</hi> Knight of the Divided Heart <hi>and this Shield well ſignifies the ſorrow, in which I have to this day lived, till it was almoſt ſtifled by length of Time: But I have now found it in ſuch manner renewed in me, that this Name is more ſutable to me than ever.</hi>

Being thus Driven by the Tempeſt, they were carryed at laſt to a very fair Iſland, well planted with Trees, where they went aſhore. Then <hi>Floreſtan</hi> took <hi>Eſclariana</hi> by the Hand, and as he was walking with her to refreſh her under the ſhade, liſtning to the Notes of many little Birds there flew over their Heads two great Griffins, who ſo frightned the Princeſs, that without the Aſſurance given her by <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> ſhe had dyed. Yet did they not therefore ſtop, but went on to a Clear Fountain, which, iſſuing from the Rock, made a little Lake, in the midſt of which was placed an high Pillar of Marble, having on it the Effigies of a Lady, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

Wherefore <hi>Floreſtan,</hi> in a manner Deſperate, followed her, ſaying in himſelf: <hi>GOD never help me if I thus forſake my Lady.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then running after her, he had no ſooner ſet his Foot within the Rock, but met the moſt terrible Monſter imaginable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he reſembled a Wild Man ſave that he was without an Head, and had his eyes in his Stomach, being bigger than the taleſt Giant that ever were ſeen. In his Hand he had a great Club with which he ſtruck <hi>Floreſtan</hi> ſuch a blow on the Head, that, being ready to fall, he was forced to put his knee to the ground: Nevertheleſs he got eaſily up again, and approaching of the Monſter, gave him ſuch a blow with his Sword, that he ſeparated one of his Legs from his Body, ſo that he fell down to the Ground, giving a great Cry. Then <hi>Floreſtan</hi> fell upon him, and made an end of killing him, when he perceived near him a Lady, having on long white Vails, and leaning on a Staff, who ſaid to him in great Wrath: <hi>In an ill hour, Sir Knight, had you ever ſo much Power, as ſo light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to kill the Guard of my Cave.</hi>

               <p>Scarce had <hi>Floreſtan</hi> received the blow of the Staff, but he ſtood upright, and like a Man deprived of his Senſes, thought on nothing but keeping the Entrance of the Cave.

               <p>
                  <hi>Who?</hi> anſwered <hi>Maragnon: You your ſelf, who have taken away the fair Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, we took Yeſterday.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Indeed?</hi> ſaid the other: <hi>and what ſhall I have?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then they drew near each other, and were about to fight. Which their People would not permit, but interpoſing between them, deſired them to have a little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, till a more diligent ſearch was made for the loſt Damſel, and if ſhe were not found, that they would caſt Lots who ſhould have the Lady. This Advice ſeemed reaſonable unto them, and there was no Cabin, great or little, nor any hole or corner in the Ship, left unranſackt: till at laſt they perceived that one of their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:154293:94"/> was miſſing, and had certainly carry'd her away in the Shiff. This augmented the Tears and Lamentations of the poor Mother, who having before her eyes the damnable Intention of the Picars, that were about to caſt Lots for her, the loſs of her Daughter, whom ſhe certainly thought to have been forc'd both in Body and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the Remembrance of her Husband, ſo lately Murthered, was ready to fall into Diſpair, and at the point of throwing her ſelf into the water, rather than ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any more. Which ſhe had undoubtedly done had not the fear of loſing her ſoul withheld her: as alſo the coming on of a great Adventure put a ſtop to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
               <p>Some of the Ship diſcovered a Veſſel, which the Storm had driven into thoſe parts: which they no ſooner perceived, but there began an Alarm amongſt them, crying out to go pillage it, and take thoſe that were in it Priſoners. Then the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats put themſelves in a readineſs to fight, and drew near the Veſſel, which they joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Hooks and Grapling-Irons. But they entred not into it ſo eaſily as they thought for: For a Knight, covered with very Rich Arms, who was in it accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with fifteen others, preſented themſelves well Armed, and with a very good will, not only to reſiſt them, but alſo to defeat them, if they paſſed any farther. And what gave them yet more occaſion ſo to do, was, that he, who was ſo well Armed, preſently knew the Princeſs <hi>Briſenna</hi> making her Lamentation, and calling to GOD for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour: at which he had ſuch compaſſion and diſpleaſure, that without demurring any longer, he ran upon the Pirats, and ſupported by his Companions, entred into their Ship: then with his head bow'd down, what hinderance ſoever they gave him, he took the Princeſs by the arm, and led her into his Veſſel, whilſt his Companions made him way. So he delivered her to the guard of his Eſquires, and returned ſpeedily to the Battle, where all behaved themſelves ſo valiantly, that there was never ſeen a more cruel Sea-fight, for the few people they were. For he in the Rich Arms and <hi>Maragnon,</hi> joyning each other, ſufficiently, ſhew'd the little Amity there was between them: So that by their well fighting, each of the two Pirats took Courage, and grew bold, they being indeed all ſtout Knights, eſpecially <hi>Brutus.</hi> Nevertheleſs the Corſaires began at laſt to ſtagger, and retreat into their Veſſel: for <hi>Maragnon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten down, was carryed in by two Servants, thinking to ſave his life. Nor could the others any longer reſiſt him in the rich Armor, when it fortun'd, that there came by a Boat with two Oars, in which there Sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r was ſeen. He of whom I ſpeak, went to the place where <hi>Maragnon</hi> lay, and ſeeing ſo different a Combat, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſecretly the occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir Knight,</hi> anſwered <hi>Maragnon, a Raſcal whom you ſee there in rich Armor, has Wickedly Aſſaul ed me to take from me a Lady, whom I love more than my ſelf: and has her at this preſent actually in his Veſſel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is it ſo?</hi> ſaid the white Knight: <hi>if I can, I will make him repent it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he commanded his Boat to go near, and taking his Sword in his hand, he
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:154293:95"/> put himſelf among the Combatants, on the Pirates ſide, and ſtriking every way, met with one of the others, whom he ſlew upon the place. Then <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and his Companions, took heart again; and the others began to give back, till they came near the place where the Princeſs was: At which he, in the Rich Armor, being vext, and knowing, that this Misfortune befell them by the Effort of the white Knight, made up to him, and gave him ſuch a blow on his Helmet, that he was very ſenſible of the weight of it, and would willingly have revenged himſelf; but they were ſo near to one another, that the white Knight had not room to lift up his Arm: Wherefore he ſtretched forth his left hand, and caught hold of the ſtraps of his Adverſarys Shield, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ich he pulled to himſelf with ſuch force, that he, in the rich Armor, was brought, whether he would or no, with his noſe to the ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now indeed,</hi> ſaid the other, <hi>will I make you reſtore the Ladies which you t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>And taking hold of his Helmet, pluckt it from his Head, and was lifting up his Sword to ſtrike him, when he preſently knew him: For 'twas <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalin,</hi> who, as you have been told, went to look for King <hi>Amadis,</hi> in the great <hi>Siclades,</hi> and finding him to be removed, would not return into great <hi>Britain</hi> without him. Therefore he ſtill went about ſeeking him, till he fell into the hands of him in the white Arms, which was <hi>Amadis,</hi> whom the Storm had dri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en into that Sea.</p>
               <p>That the King was both amazed, and glad at this meeting, you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily believe: Wherefore he ſuddainly held his hand, ſaying to him he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him: <hi>Ah!</hi> Gandalin, <hi>is it poſſible, that you are grown a Taker of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by force! VVhat will the Counteſs your wife ſay, when ſhe knows of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this word <hi>Gandalin</hi> underſtood his Maſter's Voice, and being more joyful, than he had been ſorrowful, anſwered him: <hi>How, Sir, do you call it forcing of Ladies, when I fought to deliver my Lady</hi> Briſenna, <hi>your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, from theſe Corſairs, who were carrying her away againſt her will? By my Head, you have been exceedingly deceived: for you have almoſt vanquiſht us all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King, ſeized with Amazement and Fury, could not anſwer him: But left <hi>Gandalin,</hi> and turned againſt the Pirates, of whom he made ſuch a ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the moſt part of them were put to the Sword, and the reſt fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea. Then the King commanded that all their Speil ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into <hi>Gandalins</hi> Ship, and the other ſet on Fire, which was immediately done. Then <hi>Amadis</hi> went to his Daughter, who, finding her ſelf delivered from the Danger ſhe had been in, and ſeeing the King in good health; the Lamentations, ſhe was before making, were converted into praiſes of our Lord, and ſhe threw her ſelf at his feet, having her heart ſo ſeized, that ſhe
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:154293:95"/> could not ſpeak one word to him. But he took her up, asking her, what Fortune had ſeparated her from the Emperor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alas! alas! Sir,</hi> anſwered ſhe, <hi>You may well name it Fortune, the ſtrangeſt and moſt wretched, that ever befell poor deſolate woman!

The <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> and <hi>Gradamart,</hi> Sailing in full Sea, ſometimes with fair Weather, and very often with Storms, there came upon the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> a Remembrance of the Fair <hi>Lucella,</hi> which diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted him Night and Day: ſo that he became wholly Solitary, taking pleaſure in nothing, but being alone, and muſing, ſaying ſometimes to himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ah! ah! poor Wretch, had it not been better, thou hadſt, remained for ever Enchanted, and pierced with the Sword, which</hi> Gradaſilea <hi>thruſt into thy Stomach near the</hi> Chamber of Treaſure? <hi>Alas!

Ah, ah, poor Wretch! knowing thy little merit, and her Highneſs, the greateſt Benefit that can befall thee, is to dye ſpeedily! for 'twere not reaſonable that ſo great a Lady as ſhe is ſhould abaſe herſelf to regard the Good or Evil, that is Deſtined to thee. And moreover, if ſhe ſhould endeavour to cure thee, 'tis certain, that her Reputation would be leſſened: Thus inſtead of receiving Service by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Then he fell into a Fit of Deſpair and Diſcontent, that he was almoſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up the Ghoſt: and the more he thought to extinguiſh, or leſſen his flame, the more did he reſemble him, that throws a little Water on a burning Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n ce. Which <hi>Gradamart</hi> perceiving, uſed all poſſible Endeavours to divert his Thoughts. Whence it happened one night that as they were diſcourſing together, inſtead of ſleeping, they heard the ſound of an Harp, joyn'd with the Voice of a Gentleman, which together made a wonderful ſweet Harmony. They both roſe up, and perceived a Fleet of Ships, in one of which were twelve Flambeaus lighted under a Canopy of Cloth of Gold, where lay a young and handſome Knight, who Sung and Play'd on that Inſtrument. He, of whom I ſpeak, had his Armor on his back, but his head and hands bare, and at his Beds-head was ſet a Perron of Alabaſter, very well wrought, and on it the Statue of a Lady, divinely fair, and ſo exquiſitely carv'd, that it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing but Speech. In her right hand ſhe had a Chain of Gold, which in the form of a Coſlar went about the Knights Neck, and on her Head a Crown with a Writing, containing theſe words: <hi>Onoria <hi>of</hi> Apolonia, <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Beauty.</hi>
                  </hi> In her left hand ſhe had three other little Chains, with which were faſtned by the Neck three Statues of Damſels, crown'd with Royal Cronws, ſitting at her Feet, and having each of them her Writing, of which the firſt was <hi>Luciana;</hi> the ſecond <hi>Imperia</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> and the third <hi>Alegria</hi> Infanta of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> And a little aſide behind the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, hung a great Shield, of the brighteſt Steel, without any painting, with the Knights Helmet and Sword. At his Feet were alſo two other Knights, lying on a Carpet, compleatly armed, except Helmets and Gantlets. <hi>Grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mart</hi> and the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> wondring at that Adventure, cauſed their Veſſel to approach that, in which the Torches were.</p>
               <p>At that very time the Knight, who had been ſinging, break forth in theſe Words: <hi>Ah,</hi> Lucella, <hi>Princeſs of</hi> Sicily, <hi>how great Misfortune is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln me, by having heard ſo great Commendations of you and your Beauty: For, from the day that my heart and mind have had a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of your perfections, I have neither Reſt nor Eaſe.</hi> Then he held his Peace, without ceaſing to ſigh.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> who felt himſelf ſtung by theſe Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, became ſo melancholly and penſive, that he was even ready to Dye, when he heard him name her, whoſe paſſiona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:154293:98"/> Before he gets from me, I will make him change his Opinion, if I can, or it ſhall coſt one of us his Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In good faith,</hi> anſwered <hi>Gradamart, you will not do wiſely: For neither he nor any other can do you any injury, by loving where he ſhall think good: Since if he places his Affection on an Object, not deſerved nor attainable by him, he prepares for himſelf a greater Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than any one can give him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis true,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword, and I certainly know it my ſelf: And nevertheleſs 'twould be impoſſible for him to ſuffer ſo much pain, as ſhe, of whom he ſpeaks, deſerves praiſe. But beſides, what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Glory can he pretend to, than the placing his Thoughts ſo high? If then ſuch a Thought turn to his Honour and Content, ſhould I not be a very Novice to ſuffer in my preſence the Graſs to be thus cut under my feet, Ah! I ſhould think my ſelf unworthy ever to bear the name of Knight: Since alſo I viſibly know, that he carrys this Statue, thus ſet up, expreſly for Love of her. Therefore I beſeech you trouble my Head no farther: for in matters of Love, Counſel is no way approv'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As he ſpeak this, the very Fire appeared in his Eyes, and from the ſide of his Veſſel, he called to the Knight, that held the Harp, ſaying to him: <hi>You Sir Knight, who can ſing otherwiſe of Love than you deſerve: Come near, good Sir, or I ſhall go to you, to let you know how diſordered your Head is, ſince it belongs not to you, nor any that reſembles you, to ſpeak of her whom you praiſe, and for whom you thus ſuffer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the other, who was in ſuch a Muſe upon his Love, that he had not till then perceived him, heard this Threat, he ſuddenly threw off the Chain, he had about his Neck, and lacing on his Helmet, took his Shield, and went bravely towards the other Veſſel, where he ſaw <hi>Gradamart</hi> and his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whom he calmly anſwered: <hi>Certainly, Knight, I will not deny either to you, or any other, but that I am guilty of folly, for loving in the place that my heart hath choſen: for all the merits in the World are in my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And nevertheleſs my Loyalty being ſo great, that it exceeds my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys, I have preſumed to venture on ſo high an Attempt: Yet I am of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that neither of them have a greater Share in me, than Pride and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption have in you, who make me ſo uncourteous a Diſcourſe, full of Threats and Injuries. And to the end you may another time forbear gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Counſel to thoſe, that ask it not of you, the edge of my Sword ſhall teach you, that you ſhould have held your peace, when you began for to ſpeak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Scarce had he uttered this Word, but he went up on the ſide of his Ship, and there began between him and the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eleſt Fight, that ever was ſeen.

Which the two Combatants themſelves alſo thought ſtrange; for the more they proceeded, the more they were to begin, ſo that thoſe, who beheld them, expected nothing but their Death, or at leaſt ſo many wounds on their Bodies, that they would not be quit for a Months keeping their Chamber. Becauſe that when the one had given a blow that drew the blood, his Enemy anſwered him in the ſame manner; ſo that 'twas difficult to diſcern to which of them Fortune pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd the moſt: and <hi>Gradamart</hi> would have ſeparated them, could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This Speech ſo diſpleas'd the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> that looking on <hi>Gradamart</hi> with a diſcontented eye, he thus anſwered him: <hi>Ah!

               <p>This put <hi>Gradamart</hi>'s Companion in ſuch a Fury, that he could ſcarce forbear Outraging him, ſaying: <hi>In an ill hour, Sir Knight, have you bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken my Deſign; but you ſhall repent it.</hi>

And in this Intention, finding one day a fit opportunity, he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſought his Father to give him the Order of Knighthood. Which he refuſed him not, but Armed him, and the Solemnity of it was very great through all <hi>Spain.</hi> But the ſame day, as they aroſe from Table, he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on his knees before the King, and, with a very Good Grace asked him a Gift. <hi>Don Brian,</hi> who loved him as himſelf, was Liberal in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you will permit me then to make a Journey into</hi> Sicily, <hi>to ſee the Infan a</hi> Lucella, <hi>who is at this day eſteemed the moſt perfectly fair and beſt behaved Lady in</hi> Europe: <hi>And if it is ſo, I will endeavour ſo to ſerve the King her Father, that he ſhall give her to me afterwards for Wife, if I ask her or him.</hi>

But his Labour was in vain, becauſe he found there no body but the Governour, whom <hi>Alpatracy</hi> had left, by whom he was acquainted with what was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Which wonderfully diſpleaſed him, and he curſed his Fortune for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deprived him of ſo fair an Occaſion, by which he might have gained what he much doubted to loſe. Then he returned again into his Ship, and taking leave of the Governor, went back towards <hi>Sicily,</hi> where he thought to find what he lookt for.</p>
               <p>And ſome days after he met a Giant, that was carrying away ſeveral <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Priſoners, with whom <hi>Birmartes</hi> had a fight, and finally van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſht him: The Duke of <hi>Biſcays</hi> two Sons defeated alſo ſix of his Knights, freeing all the Slaves, who were then in the Pirates Ship, and giving them Liberty to go, whither they pleaſed. And thus following their way, to take

And to refreſh themſelves, being weary of the Sea, they deſign'd to ſpend a Month in Viſiting the Country. And for this cauſe commanding their Marriners not to depart from the Port, all the Knights mounted their Horſes, taking their Way ſtrait to the great City of <hi>Apolonia.</hi> And, as they travell'd, they learnt, how <hi>Branzahar</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> guarded in a Tower <hi>Onoria,</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Apolonia,</hi> who was reputed to be one of the fair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſt Ladies on the Earth. And that you may underſtand the manner and Reaſon of this Guarding, you will know, that this Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> was a very powerful Knight, but hard favoured, deform'd, Ill-behav'd, and beſides de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended of a Giantly Lineage. Now the great Beauty of <hi>Onoria</hi> had been ſo advantageouſly related to him, that his Heart was ſmitten with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: And to ſee her, he came to the King her Fathers Court, accompany'd by two Giants his Coſins: But the Ladies Preſence ſo depriv'd him of his Liberty, that he thought, he ſhould dye, if he had her not for Wife. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with great Earneſtneſs and Importunity he requeſted her of the King, who knowing him to be ſuch an one, that is Daughter would never conſent to it, excus'd himſelf, by pretending, that ſhe had no Inclination to marry. The Duke, much aſtoniſht at this News, was ready then to diſpair: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs for the laſt Remedy he ſaid to the King, that ſince Fortune had been ſo unkind to him in denying him the thing, he moſt lov'd in this world, he ſhould never have any Ioy in his Heart; yet in recompence of the Pains, he had taken to come to his Court, he deſired him that he would be pleaſed to grant him a Gift. Which the King would not deny him, provided his Daughters Honour were not offended by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That certainly Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it ſhall not be: For I would ſooner conſent to my own Ruin. But ſince ſhe will ſpend her Life without an Husband, and that her Beauty puts thoſe who ſee her in an unparallel'd Torment, 'tis reaſonable for the avoiding ſo much Miſchief, that ſhe be henceforth ſhut up in a Tower, where ſhe ſhall be ſeen by none but you, the Queen, and thoſe that ſhall be ordained to ſerve her. And I and theſe two Giants will keep the three firſt Entrances, ſo that none ſhall paſs them, unleſs it be by force of Arms. And moreover he muſt, for her Service, accompliſh the Conditions, which I ſhall cauſe to be written, and hung upon certain ſtones, that ſhall be erected in this Tower: by which, ſaid he, ſhall be known the greatneſs of your Daughters Beauty, and how much I ſuffer, and will ſuffer for her ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then was the King diſpleaſed at his having ſo lightly promiſed, what he could not with his Honour revoke, and would gladly have found an Excuſe,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:154293:101"/> that might have contented the Prince of <hi>Clarence,</hi> but the ſtone being thrown, and out of his hand, could not be recalled: wherefore he reſolved to bow down his Head, and permit his Daughter to be ſhut up, as he had been deſired.

In the midſt there was a Bed, of which the Canopy, Curtains, Coverings, and Baſes, were of Crimſon Satin, Richly Embroidered, and ſet with Pearls, Rubies, Diamonds, and Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds: And beſide it, hung all ſorts of Muſical Inſtrumenes, on which <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noria</hi> could play. This Priſon then being finiſht as you have underſtood, <hi>Branzahar</hi> appointed to be ſet before it a Pillar of Allabaſter, and on the top of it the Effigies of the Princeſs cut to the Life, with a writing round about her Head in the form of a Ducal Cap, which contained theſe words: <hi>Onoria, <hi>Lady of beauty.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>This done, he took the Infanta, and ſhut her up under a ſtrong padlock, of which himſelf kept the key, and leaving her Damſels without, he ſaid: <hi>Here ſhall you be incloſed, to Recompence the Cruel Priſon of Love, in which you keep me Captive, and ſhall not come forth till ſuch time as he comes, who, eaſing me of this pain, ſhall himſelf receive a greater, in ſeeing your over great and dangerous Beauty.</hi>

               <p>Then he faſtned a Writing to the pillar, the contents of which were theſe: <hi>Thou Knight, who by thy Proweſs art come to this place, where thou mayſt ſee the Faireſt Princeſs of the world, be not ſo hardy as to take her forth, before thou haſt carryed this Image, which repreſents her Perſon, through the whole Earth, and maintained by Force of Arms, that ſhe, for whom it was made, is the firſt in great Beauty.

Then, and no ſooner, ſhalt thou be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to take the Fair One out of Priſon.

               </p>
               <p>Having faſtned this Writing, he caus'd another Pillar to be ſet up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt and principal Gate of the Tower, with a Roll containing what follows. <hi>Let none henceforward adventure to paſs any far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And preſently he appointed one of his Giants for the Guard of this gate, and another for the ſecond, and himſelf for the third: And they three, Arm'd with very rich Armor, undertook to fight all Comers. At which the King exceedingly wondred, that ſuch and ſo great a Lord as <hi>Branzahar,</hi> would put himſelf in ſuch ſubjection, and danger of his Perſon. Now he was a good Knight, and they whom he had choſen, ſtrong and hardy, which made the ſpeedy Deliverance of <hi>Oriana</hi> little expected: But the King and Queen might ſee her when they thought good, and this little ſhe took as a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in her Fortune. Of which <hi>Birmartes</hi> advertiz'd, immediatly thought, according to the Renown of <hi>Branzahar,</hi> that ſhe, for whom he undertook ſo great a Charge, muſt needs be very fair: Wherefore he askt ſome of the Countrey, whether this Adventure had not yet been try'd by any one. He was anſwer'd, that above an Hundred Knights, as well of the Court, as Strangers, had done their Endeavours, but they had all been vanquiſht by the Giant of the firſt Gate: So that 'twas now ſix Months ſince any one had dar'd to preſent himſelf before him. Now the more that was ſaid of it to <hi>Birmartes</hi> the more did his Deſire of going to ſee this Fair One encreaſe: ſo that he reſolved, what ever might happen, to try his Fortune for the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her at Liberty. But he knew not what was contain'd in the writing, faſtned to the Pillar of the Image, as you have been told: For it was indeed unknown to all. By occaſion of which many good Knights put their Lives in hazard, hoping to gain Honour, and the love of <hi>Onoria.</hi> So <hi>Birmartes,</hi> and his two Companions <hi>Eſquinel</hi> and <hi>Meander,</hi> travell'd till they came to the City of <hi>Apolonia,</hi> where he deſired they would ſhew him <hi>Onorias</hi> Tower.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:154293:102"/> to him: <hi>Good, Knight, if Fortune will ſo favour you, that you can pull down the Pride of the Duke, and deliver my Daughter, aſſure your ſelf, I will greatly recompence you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Birmartes,</hi> ſeeing the good Reception the King gave him, thus anſwered him: <hi>Sir, he, in whoſe hands all things are, knows the deſire I have to ſerve you, and ſuch as you: eſpecially in ſuch Acts, in which, beſides the Honor that may be gain'd, conſiſts the liberty of ſuch a Princeſs as my Lady your Daughter: Not that I will preſume to promiſe my ſelf the putting an end to that, to which ſo many good Knights could not attain: but at leaſt I will do my Endeavour, being aſſured, that, ſo doing, Death or Life can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be honourable to me, imitating the Gallant Men, who have tryed it before me, and in compariſon of whom I am nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he prepared himſelf to begin the Fight, becauſe the firſt Giant ſtood ready to receive him. They delay'd not therefore long to run one againſt the other, neither of them miſſing his Blow: For the Gyant ſtruck him with ſuch force on the Shield that he pierc'd it, and his Spear, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing under his Arm, appeared above a yard on the other ſide. But <hi>Birmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> who ran in a more even line, aiming lower, ſtruck him between the Saddle-bow and the Stomach, ſo that, the Plates of the Gyant's Armor, not being ſtrong enough to reſiſt the Fierceneſs of the blow, the Lance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into his Guts, and he fell dead to the Ground, without ſtirring either foot or hand.

But this Opinion laſted not long: for he, withdrawing his Lance, march'd towards the ſecond Gate, where he found the other Guard, exceedingly troubled for his Coſins death, to revenge whom, he coutch'd his Spear, and ſetting ſpurs to his Horſe, miſt his blow. But ſo did not <hi>Birmartes,</hi> who met him ſo roughly, that his Lance flew into ſhivers, and with the ſhock, their Horſes gave each other, they both fell, and their Maſters under them. Nevertheleſs <hi>Birmartes</hi> got ſpeedily up again on his feet, and taking his Sword in his hand, perceived the other, who lamented exceedingly for the extream pain he felt, having his left Leg bruis'd in three or four places, and his Steed ſo lying on him, that he was not able to ſtir.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Birmartes</hi> coming to him, ſaid: <hi>Giant, thou art dead, if thou doſt not yield thy ſelf vanquiſht, and permit me, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hindrance, the Entrance of this Gate, as I ſhall think good.</hi>

               <p>Then <hi>Birmartes</hi> paſs'd on, and perceiv'd <hi>Branzahar,</hi> mounted on a great black Horſe, who came to meet him. Now he was hard-favor'd, and ill-ſhapt,

               <p>Saying this, he ſet foot to ground, and embracing his great and ſtrong Shield, with his naked ſword in his hand, march'd towards <hi>Birmartes,</hi> who having heard him ſpeak ſo graciouſly, anſwer'd him in this manner: <hi>My Lord Prince, your Courteſy has more amaz'd me, than the greatneſs of your Body, and the ſtrength and largeneſs of your Limbs: for the Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Hearts conſiſts not in the Maſs of Fleſh, but in Generoſity and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Perſon, who loves Honour, and deſires to perpetuate his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not by boaſting and Arrogance, but by doing his Duty with few and gentle Words, and Vigorous Execution: ſo that having already found in you one of theſe two points, which is Courteſy, I make no doubt but the ſecond is not far from it: ſeeing they are ſeldom, or never aſunder, no more than Fire is from Heat, and Heat from Fire.

               <p>
                  <hi>Branzahar,</hi> ſeeing himſelf in this Extremity, had his heart much oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but not knowing how to remedy it, he thus anſwered <hi>Birmartes: I now well know, that 'tis a great Folly to attempt the breaking and forcing what Fortune has ordained, who has hitherto been ſo contrary to me, that by making me love her, who is fairer than beauty it ſelf, I am reduced to the ſhame, in which every one may ſee me: therefore, Knight, do with me what thou pleaſeſt, ſince 'tis in thy power, if thou thinkſt good, to give me my death, which conſidering the Misfortune of my life, I deſire more than thou imagineſt. Go then at thy eaſe to ſee her, whoſe look alone has ſuch Power, that the force, thou haſt had againſt me and mine, will not perhaps be able to preſerve thee from dying at the ſight of her.

                  <p>How <hi>Birmartes</hi> went to ſee the Fair <hi>Onoria</hi> in her Priſon: and the Diſcourſe they had together.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>BRanzahar,</hi> Prince of <hi>Clarence,</hi> being carry'd out of the Field, and <hi>Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes</hi> remaining gloriouſly Victorious, the King came to embrace him, ſaying to him: <hi>Ah! fortunate Knight, and more couragious than can be expreſs'd, let us go, if you pleaſe, to my Daughter, whom I hope, thro' your Proweſs, ſhortly to ſee at liberty, and my ſelf quit of the promiſe I made the Prince, who kept her ſo cloſely impriſon'd to my great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us go, Sir,</hi> anſwered <hi>Birmartes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, accompany'd by many gallant Knights, they went into the Hall, where <hi>Onorias</hi> Priſon was, as you have heard. Now the Heat of the day was ſo exceſſive, that <hi>Birmartes</hi> took off his Helmet, and delivered it to one
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:154293:104"/> of his Attendants, having an unuſual colour in his face, when the King preſented him to his fair Daughter: who, having already underſtood by her Damſels the Iſſue of his fight with <hi>Branzahar,</hi> whom ſhe mortally hated was the Ioyfulleſt Woman in the world. And this pleaſure render'd her Countenance ſo gay, that join'd with the Excellence of her Beauty, it made her come very near <hi>Lucellas</hi> Perfection, this her Cheerfulneſs having given her a Grace more Divine than Humane.</p>
               <p>Then the King ſaid to his Daughter: <hi>Child, look on this Knight, who has for your ſake done this day incredible Feats of Arms, and will, I believe, ſoon give you the opportunity of going forth from this Place: wherefore 'tis my Opinion, and Requeſt that you treat him with Reſpect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In good Faith, Sir,</hi> anſwered ſhe, <hi>I ſhould be very ungrateful, ſhould I fail to do it, ſeeing the Obligation I have to him, who has already done ſo much for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe ſtretcht forth her Arm thro' the Grate, to lift him up: for he was on his Knees, as ſurpriz'd with her Love, and that with ſuch ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence that, forgetting the Affection he had to that time born to her, for whom he had Travers'd ſo many Seas, the word <hi>Branzahar</hi> had ſaid to him, was found true in him, which he remembred very well: and therefore took her gently by the hand, and kiſſing it, ſaid: <hi>Madam, the Prince did as he ought, in keeping you from being ſeen, ſince your gracious look is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to kill men without Remedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Onoria</hi> bluſht a little at this praiſe, but not for any Diſpleaſure, ſhe had at it: for <hi>Birmartes</hi> ſeem'd to her ſo accompliſht a Knight, that ſhe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly taken with him. And as ſhe was going to anſwer him, the King interrupted their Diſcourſe, and ſhewing <hi>Birmartes</hi> the Image and Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſtned to the Pillar, ſaid to him: <hi>My dear Friend, you have already done ſo much, that you may be ſtiled the beſt Knight in the world; yet there is more to be done, if you will finiſh this Adventure.

And to ſhew you that this is true, I accept from this time this office, truſting, that where Proweſs ſhall

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In good faith,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>I am more ſecure of your Courage, than of my Daughters Beauty: And affectionatly thank you for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Good you deſire me. But let us go to my Palace, where you ſhall be well lookt to: for I am ſure you are Wounded in ſeveral places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>Birmartes</hi> would firſt take leave of <hi>Onoria,</hi> who had heard all he ſaid of her, &amp; the Promiſe he made to defend her Beauty throughout the World. Which caus'd in her ſuch a Regard for him, that beholding him with her gracious Eye, ſhe humbly entreated him, that he would, after he was Cur'd, come again to her before his Departure. This requeſt he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly granted, and bowing very low, went his way, leaving her no leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of him, than he was ready to ſerve her all his life. For Love at that inſtant ſeiz'd of their Hearts, mutually transferring them by his Divine Power into each others body, without their having any Perception, or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of it, but by the heat of the laſting fire, which he then kindled in them. Thus <hi>Birmartes</hi> followed the King, who, as they went along, askt him his Name and Quallity, but he beſought him to excuſe him for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, telling him that he ſhould at another time underſtand it all: VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, ſeeing him deſirous to conceal himſelf, would no farther im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune him. Diſcourſing then of other matters, they came to the Palace, where <hi>Birmartes</hi> was very kindly welcomed by the Queen and the Ladies, who conducted him into a richly furniſht Chamber, and to do him the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Honour, diſarm'd him with their own Hands, and put him to Bed. Then came Chyrurgions to viſit his wounds, of which they promis'd him a ſpeedy Cure, deſiring every one to retire and let him ſleep. But when he was alone, he began inſtead of reſting to meditate on the Beauty of his new Miſtreſs, no longer complaining of <hi>Lucella,</hi> who had been the cauſe of his coming into theſe Parts, where he had ſeen what gave him ſo much Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Onoria,</hi> for whom he was tormented ſuffering no leſs. But <hi>Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martes,</hi> not able to keep this fire any long time ſmothering within his breaſt, diſcover'd ſome few days after his thoughts to his two Companions, <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinel</hi> and <hi>Meander,</hi> who comforted him in the beſt manner they could, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him hopes, that he being return'd, and having finiſht what he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the King of <hi>Appollonia</hi> would think himſelf happy to give him his Daughter to Wife.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How <hi>Birmartes,</hi> being cur'd, departed from the King of <hi>Appollonia,</hi> and <hi>Onoria,</hi> to begin his Enterpriſe, and the ſucceſs of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Deſire <hi>Birmartes</hi> had to accompliſh his Promiſe, made to maintain <hi>Onorias</hi> Beauty in all places, very much forwarded the Cure of his wounds, which being perfected, he caus'd his Ships to be put in ſuch Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, as the <hi>Knight of the burning ſword</hi> found them in, when they fought.</p>
               <p>Then the day of his Embarking being come, he addreſs'd himſelf to the King, and ſaid to him: <hi>Sir, foraſmuch as I reſolve to ſet forth preſently to Sea, I humbly deſire of you, that I may ſee my Lady your Daughter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Departure, to the end ſhe may in your preſence, and with your leave grant me a gift, that I will ask of her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Well then,</hi> anſwered the King, <hi>let us go thither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the King brought him to the Tower, whither being come, after Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on both ſides, <hi>Birmartes</hi> ſet knee to the ground, and addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felf to <hi>Onoria,</hi> ſaid to her: <hi>Madam, I am, according to your command, come to take leave of you, for to accompliſh what I have wilingly oblig'd my ſelf to, hoping (with Juſt Reaſon) not to fall into any danger that can hurt me, being accompany'd by your good wiſhes, with which I beſeech you to favour me, as alſo with the Honour of ſtiling my ſelf henceforth your Knight <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Onoria,</hi> very glad to ſee that preſented to her, which ſhe with all her heart deſir'd, made him this Anſwer: <hi>In good deed I find my ſelf very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that ſuch a Knight, as you are, vouchſafes to name himſelf mine, and I ſhould be too indiſcreetly nice ſhould I refuſe this Offer, which I accept, and requeſt it of you, as much as poſſibly I can, truſting ſo far in your Valour, that my Beauty (which is little in reſpect of ſo many other excellent Ladies) will gain repute thro' the world, your Courage ſupplying in it, what Nature has omitted: But one thing more I will deſire of you, which is, that you tell me your Name, to the end I may henceforth better know him, who is mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>I will never diſobey you, be pleaſed then to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that I am nam'd</hi> Birmartes <hi>the Amorous, and that with good Reaſon: For only Love, and ſhe, whoſe I am, have Power over me.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:154293:105"/>
               <p>This ſurname did <hi>Birmartes</hi> give himſelf, which he never afterwards loſt. <hi>Onoria</hi> very well underſtood the End, at which he aim'd, as did alſo the King, who did not at all diſlike it, but immediatly reſolv'd, that at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, if he were found worthy of her, he would give him his Daughter in Marriage, who (had it not be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n for the Kings Preſence) would not have ſtuck in ſo fair a way, having matter enough for a longer Entertainment with her Friend: But ſhe durſt not ſay any more, nor he neither, who had her Adieu, leaving her in ſtrange Pain, thro' the Fire kindled in her heart by Love, who before <hi>Birmartes</hi>'s Arrival had not the leaſt Power over her. But he then ſhew'd himſelf victorious, ſo that to manifeſt the Beginning of his Trophy, he fill'd her Eyes with Tears, and her heart with ſighs and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. Thus it is, that this Beautiful Boy treats thoſe, that obey him, who are very often reduc'd to ſuch Blindneſs, that nothing pleaſes them, but what is moſt hurtful for them. <hi>Birmartes</hi> then, being gone forth from the Preſence, come to the Piller, and took her Image, ſaying ſo loud, that every one might h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ar him. <hi>Certainly, Portraiture, 'tis my Intention to bring you back to this Place, ſo well accompany'd, that every one ſhall know your Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he went out of the Hall, and with the Kings good Leave, having arm'd himſelf, went aboard his Ship, and placing the Effigies, he brought with him upon a rich Pillar, he ſet ſail ſtrait for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he went aſhore, and there in the Preſence of the Princes and Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Occaſion of his Voyage. Wherefore a Son of the King of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garies,</hi> loving above all others <hi>Luciana</hi> the Emperors Daughter, undertook to maintain, that his Miſtreſs was fairer then <hi>Onoria:</hi> Whereupon they came to a Fight, in which <hi>Birmartes</hi> was Victorious, and carry'd the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture of <hi>Luciana</hi> into his Veſſel, where he faſtned it to the Pillar with a little Chain underneath the other. After this he had ſeveral Combats with many other good Knights: But he car'd not for having the Effigies of thoſe, they lov'd, not thinking them worthy to accompany his Portraiture, unleſs they were the Daughters of Emperors or Kings: For to that, and no more, he was oblig'd.</p>
               <p>After this he made no long ſtay in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but taking leave of the Emperor and the Knights of his Court, went to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> where he won the Image of the Infanta <hi>Alegria,</hi> the Kings Daughter, gaining the Victory over a Duke, who was greatly in love with her, as alſo over many others, which would be tedious to name.</p>
               <p>Thence he took his way to <hi>Bohemia,</hi> where he entred the Field againſt another Duke, from whom he gain'd the Statue of <hi>Imperia,</hi> Daughter to King <hi>Graſandor,</hi> and Queen <hi>Mabita,</hi> who was a beautiful and gallant
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:154293:106"/> Princeſs; but yet ſhe remain'd there for a Pledge, accompany'd with many other Ladies and Gentlewoman: Whence his Fame ſpred ſo far, that he was from that time in all thoſe parts nam'd the <hi>Knight us'd to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſeeing, that there was none left in <hi>Bohemia</hi> to oppoſe him, he took a Reſolution of going to <hi>Naples,</hi> having been advertiz'd that the King had a Daughter nam'd <hi>Jufaliana,</hi> a Lady of extraordinary Beauty. And indeed he was ſailing thither, when he met, the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword.</hi> So they fought, and were at laſt parted, as you have heard, at which he was ſo diſpleas'd, that he ſaid at every turn, he never ſhould have any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, till he found him again. Wherefore we ſhall ſay no more of him till a fitter Opportunity: For you well know, that this Hiſtory is not ſo much for him, as for the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> whoſe Proweſs and valor we intend chiefly here to deſcribe.</p>

Then entring into his Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, he commanded them to weigh Anchor, and follow Fortune, which could not (he ſaid) be ſo contrary to him, but that 'twould guide him to the Place, where he ſhould meet the Knight, that had parted ſo well from him.

               <p>This Command they durſt not any further diſpute, but letting looſe their Veſſel, without either Rudder, or Oar, went away with the Curent of the ſtream, being driven along by the Wind and Waves, ſix days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at the End whereof they met a Ship, on the Deck of which ſat a very ancient Man, whom the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi> ſaluted, ſaying to him: <hi>Honorable Father, GOD preſerve you: I deſire you of Courteſy to tell me, if you have ſeen met, or know any News of a Knight, that ſails along this Sea in an unuſual manner: for I muſt find him dead or living.</hi>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:154293:107"/> in the world. Nevertheleſs, ſince you ſo affectionatly requeſt it, I will tell you what I know. He has taken his Courſe towards</hi> Naples, <hi>in the way to which I met him: and that is all you can at this time learn of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>GOD give you a good Voyage,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword: You have greatly ſatisfied me.</hi>

               <p>Then commanding his Steerſman to make ſtrait for <hi>Naples,</hi> they ſoon loſt ſight of each other.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Gradamart,</hi> who had fetcht a long ſleep, awoke, and finding neither his Companion, nor his Arms, was exceedingly diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.

Wherefore he began to curſe and ban his Fortune, which was ſo contrary to him, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on ſo Good an Occaſion preſerv'd two of the Beſt Knights in the World from Death, he ſhould Receive for it ſo much Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>And in this diſcontent he cry'd out: <hi>Ah, ah!</hi> Knight of the Burning Sword! <hi>how ill do You know the great Amity your Friend</hi> Gradama<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But, let what may befal me, I will never ceaſe Travelling, till I have found you, that I may complain of you to your ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As he was thus venting his Diſcontents, he perceived on the Shore a Fiſher-Boat, into which having put ſome Proviſions, he entred, and having unfaſtned it from a Poſt, to which it was ty'd, abandon'd it to the Waves, that in a little time carry'd him out of ſight of the Land, ſo diſcontented, that he every moment wiſht his own Death, when he met the ſame Old-man that had ſpoken to the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> whom he askt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could tell him any News of a Knight, great of Stature, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in white Harneſs, who Sailed in a Boat, accompany'd only by two Marriners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In truth,</hi> anſwer'd the Old Man, <hi>you enquire after him, in finding whom you ſhall have greater Joy than you imagin: and you your ſelf ſhall be more ſought after by him, than he is by you: and more I will not tell you at this time.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Gradamart</hi> greatly wondred at this Diſcourſe, and would have deſir'd him to tell him what he meant: but the Old Man had ſcarce finiſht his ſpeech, when a brisk Gale of Wind carry'd away the Veſſel he was in, ſo that <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damart</hi> could no more get near him. Wherefore he reſolved to follow his

               </p>
               <p>Now it happened that the ſecond day after he had ſpoken to the Old-man, the Sea grew ſo Tem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore he mounted his Steed, and took the great road: along which he perceived a Damſel coming, accompany'd by one only Squire, carrying a Pacquet, wrapt up in red Camblet.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> courteouſly ſaluted them, and they returned his ſalutation, the Damſel ſaying to him: <hi>Perhaps, Sir Knight, you are one of thoſe who have ſlain the Emperor of the Countrey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why do you ſay this to me?</hi> anſwer'd the Knight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe,</hi> reply'd ſhe, <hi>that, if you are of that Faction, I adviſe you to take another way, than this of</hi> Rome: <hi>for the Marqueſs of</hi> Mantua <hi>is entred into it, with a good Number of Soldiers, and keeps it for the Empreſs</hi> Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norina, <hi>and her Grand-daughter, to whom the Empire comes by right of ſucceſſion. And whatever Knight, or other Perſon he finds, holding the part of the Duke, he certainly puts them to death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I pray you, Damſel,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword, to give me an Account of this Emperor's Death: For I never heard of it, but from you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſhe began to relate to him the Dukes Treaſon, as you have heard it. <hi>And,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>the Marqueſs has, within theſe few days, had News, that King</hi> Amadis <hi>is arriv'd at</hi> Naples, <hi>to revenge the Death of the Emperor, his Son-in-law: at which ſeveral of this Countrey are very joyful, and expect great Forces from all parts, as is reported.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As the Gods may help me, Damſel,</hi> anſwer'd the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword, I am very glad that I am arriv'd in time to do ſervice to the King you ſpeak of: for I greatly love and eſteem him</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ah!</hi> ſaid ſhe: <hi>You have Reaſon, and as far as I ſee, my way is ſhorten'd, becauſe I was charg'd to addreſs my ſelf to the firſt Knight, I ſhould meet on this way, making me ſuch Diſcourſes as you do, and preſent him what is in this Pacquet. And nevertheleſs I will cauſe it to be carried for you to the City of</hi> Naples, <hi>whither I will accompany you, as I am charg'd: and there I will tell you who it is that ſends it to you and other things, for which you will not be ſorry.

               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:154293:108"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>In good Faith, Damſel,</hi> anſwer'd the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword, you make me wonder at the News. As for me, I have nothing to do at</hi> Rome, <hi>and I think it beſt, that we ſhould go ſtraight to King</hi> Amadis; <hi>for it ſeems already long to me, till I ſee the Preſent diſplay'd, and know, who does me this Favour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us go,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I pray you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then they both went on together; but they had not been two days in Company, when they entred into a long Forreſt, where they met Five Knights compleatly Arm'd, who, addreſſing themſelves to him <hi>of the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sword,</hi> cry'd to him: <hi>Stay, Knight, ſtay: You muſt tell us, whom you will Aſſiſt, whether the Emperor of</hi> Rome, <hi>or his Adverſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will help,</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>thoſe, in whom Treaſon has no Part, and will be againſt the Duke, who has ſo baſely Murther'd his Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This,</hi> reply'd they, <hi>is the Way, you ſhould take to a ſpeedy Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſaid this, they all couch'd their Lances, and ran upon him with ſuch violence, that they wanted but little of throwing him out of his Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; yet he kept firm, and gave one of them ſuch a Blow, that he never Spake more: Then he drew his Spear out of the Dead-Mans Body, and Charging the Four others, Kill'd the Second on the Field, his Staff breaking to Shivers. Then he ſuddenly put hand to his Sword, and there began between them a wonderful Fight, which yet ſoon came to an End; for the Three that remain'd, could not bear the Fury of him, who, in ſuch manner Aſſaulted them, that the Third had his Head Cleft aſunder; which the Two laſt ſeeing, turn'd their Backs, and Fled away full Speed. But the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword</hi> let them go, and without purſuing them any farther, follow'd his way with the Damſel, who, much wondred at his great Proweſs, and high Chivalry. Now theſe Raſcals were Allies of the Duke, who, lying in Ambuſh in the Forreſt, watcht ſuch Knights as were ill Accompany'd, and fell upon them, when they underſtood them to be of the Deceas'd Emperor's Party; ſo that many Worthy Men had already, in this manner loſt their Lives, when they met with the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> who, Chaſtis'd them, as you have heard. And for this cauſe, we will leave him to Travel with the Damſel, and change our Diſcourſe.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>OVR Hiſtory has before acquainted you, how the King of <hi>Sicily, Olorius,</hi> and <hi>Don Florelus,</hi> Embarkt in Great <hi>Britain</hi> with a good Number of other Knights, and ſet Sail for <hi>France.</hi> Now they had not Sail'd Eight whole Days, when they met ſome Veſſels Commanded by the Count of <hi>Armignac,</hi> a Kinſman to the King of <hi>Metz,</hi> for whoſe ſake they were Cruiſing along the Coaſts to hinder the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> or any other of their Party from taking Port in <hi>Sicily.</hi> Now the Count immediatly knew
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:154293:109"/> by the Banners and Colors, that the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> was in the Fleet; wherefore he commanded his People to aſſault it on all ſides, hoping to take him Priſoner. Then the two Fleets joyn'd, and with Hooks and Grapling Irons, coupled their Veſſels, ſo that the Fight was Fierce and Bloody; but at length the <hi>Armignacians</hi> had the worſt, being all either Slain, or Vanquiſht, and the others remain'd Victorious, by means whereof they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood from the Priſoners, how the Emperor <hi>Arquiſil,</hi> and his Son <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerpius</hi> were Slain, and that King <hi>Amadis</hi> was Arriv'd at <hi>Naples,</hi> where he was gathering People from all Parts, to Revenge their Deaths; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that the King of <hi>Metz</hi> was Raiſing a great Army to Succor the new Emperor. This being heard by the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> a thought came ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into his Mind, that ſince his Enemy was taking that way, he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find a better Opportunity to Recover his Kingdom, than whilſt his Adverſary was abſent; and for this cauſe, he order'd his Pilots and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to make all the ſpeed they could; but as it often happens, that Man propoſes otherwiſe than GOD has diſpos'd, the Night following there aroſe ſuch a Tempeſt, that being carry'd along by the Violence of it, they found themſelves the Sixth Day after in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Sea, and were, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would or no, forc't to paſs <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Pillars, and enter into the <hi>Mediterranean:</hi> Wherefore they wholly chang'd their Deſign, and the King of <hi>Sicily</hi> was of Opinion to go and find King <hi>Amadis,</hi> that they might to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Fight the Vſurper of the Empire, and his Ally, ſince they were joyn'd.</p>
               <p>Thus they took their way to <hi>Naples,</hi> where they arriv'd almoſt at the ſame time as did <hi>Don Floreſtan,</hi> King of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> who was come thither with a great Fleet, and the Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> who, being in Love with the Fair <hi>Jufaliana,</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> had brought a great Army by Land.

               <argument>
                  <p>How <hi>Dirmartes</hi> arriv'd at the Court of <hi>Naples,</hi> where he defy'd all the Knights who were there, concerning their Miſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſſes Beauties, and the Wonders he did.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THeſe Kings and great Lords being one Day ſat at Dinner, there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Hall, a Tall and Comely Knight, compleatly Arm'd in a Rich White Armor. In his Hands he bore the Effigies of a Lady, at whoſe ſide were certain little Chains of Gold, to which were faſtned thrée Images, that were ſupported by two Knights. He, who Marcht firſt, was <hi>Birmartes</hi> the Amorous, of whom our Hiſtory has formerly ſpoken at large, who (without doing any Act of Reverence) askt a loud, if the King of <hi>Naples</hi> was there, and was anſwer'd, that he was, and was ſhewn him.</p>
               <p>Then did he addreſs himſelf firſt to the King, and afterwards to all the other Knights, ſaying, <hi>Moſt Mighty Kings and Lords, think it not ſtrange, that preſenting my ſelf before you, I have not ſhewn that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which your Excellencies deſerve; the Reaſon of which is, that I bear in my Arms this Image, which is the Repreſentation of a Princeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, whoſe Greatneſs is ſuch, that She ows no Reſpect to any King or Emperor, how powerful ſoever. And this I ſay farther, that my Arrival in this Court is only to maintain againſt all Knights, that</hi> Onoria, <hi>Lady of Beauty, Infanta of</hi> Apolonia, <hi>is Fairer than any other Lady or Damſel in the World. And this I intend to prove by Arms againſt any one, that will contradict it, on ſuch Condition, that, if the Opponent is Servant or Friend to the Daughter of any King or Emperor, for whoſe Love he enters into Fight againſt me, he ſhall be Bound to bring her Image Crown'd, and her Name Writ underneath, which he ſhall loſe, and I will joyn with theſe others, in caſe the Victory is mine; but if the Knight has a Miſtreſs of Meaner Rank, he ſhall be excus'd from bringing her Image or Portraiture. Now then, Sir,</hi> ſaid he to the King of <hi>Naples, ſince this Adventure is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd in your Court, before it is in any other of theſe Princes, I beſeech you to cauſe the occaſion of my Coming, being ſuch, as I have at preſent declar'd to you, to be Publiſht by Sound of Trumpet, to the end every Knight, who will Combat me, may know, that I will expect him in this
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:154293:110"/> Meadow in a Tent, which I will cauſe to be ſet up, and will Fight him with ſuch Arms, as he will Chooſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſaid this, he went out of the Hall, and return'd the way he came, leaving all theſe Lords Amaz'd at his Preſumption, ſo that ſeveral deſign'd to abate it, eſpecially the Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> and <hi>Clorius</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> who ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently Lov'd <hi>Luciana,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Eſplandian,</hi> that he could not reſt for her. Then came <hi>Birmartes</hi> into the Meadow, and caus'd two Rich Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilions to be ſet up on the Sea ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, in which he Lodg'd. But he had Leiſure enough to reſt there, for none Preſented himſelf that Day, no, the next till after Dinner, when ſeveral entred into the Field; and <hi>Birmartes</hi> behav'd himſelf ſo Valiantly, that before Night he Vanquiſht Twelve, and Fifteen the Day following; ſo that many had ſaid, they never ſeen ſo good a Knight. Now the Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> was not yet come, but he Preſented himſelf ſoon after, Arm'd in Green Armor, and bearing on his Helmet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Feather, his Miſtreſſes Portraiture.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Birmartes,</hi> knowing that he had a Valiant Adverſary, choſe a great Lance, and Marching leiſurely, before he began his Carrier, the Duke call'd out to him from afar; ſaying, <hi>By my Head, Sir Knight, I will now make you know, that the Princeſs</hi> Iufaliana, <hi>whoſe Effigies I bear, ſurpaſſes in all Beauties her, whom you have ſo much prais'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I know not,</hi> anſwer'd <hi>Birmartes how you can verify it: As for me, every one knows, that I ſhould extreamly forget my ſelf, if I ſhould follow this Opinion; and ſince the Proof lies in the Combat, not in Words, let us ſee how it will go.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then they couch'd their Lances, one againſt the other, and their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was ſuch, that the Duke broke his Spear, even to the Gantlet: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, <hi>Birmartes</hi> Struck him ſo to the purpoſe, that he Threw him out of his Saddle to the Ground. And foraſmuch as the Duke was aſtony'd, ſtiring neither Foot nor Hand, the other alighted from his Horſe at the End of the Carrier, and Feigning, that he would Cut off his Head, ſaid to him aloud: <hi>Knight, confeſs the Beauty of your Miſtreſs to be nothing in Compariſon of</hi> Onorias, <hi>elſe you ſhall Dye preſently.</hi>

               <p>But to theſe Threats the Duke, tho' he was come to himſelf, Anſwer'd him not a Word, but was ſo Diſconted, that he wiſht himſelf already Dead; which ſome Lord knowing, Requeſted <hi>Birmartes</hi> to leave him in Patience, and content himſelf with his Victory, and the Portraiture of <hi>Jufaliana,</hi> which he took, and carry'd into his Pavilion, to Accompany the others. In the mean time the Duke got up again, and Return'd Aſham'd to his Houſe.</p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:154293:110"/>
               <p>Then there came into the Field a luſty Knight, ſitting ſo gracefully on his Horſe, that 'twas a wonder to ſee, who addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Birmartes,</hi> thus ſpake to him: <hi>If you do not willingly confeſs my Miſtreſs to be fairer than yours, I will make you do it by force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How?</hi> anſwered <hi>Birmartes: He, who is juſt now parted with diſgrace, ſaid as much to me not long ſince, and tho' he ſhould have ſerv'd you for an Example, you ſpeak as preſumptuouſly, as he did: take heed, fair Sir, leſt as much befal you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this word they ran ſo directly one againſt the other, that their Lances flew into ſhivers, and they met ſo violently with Shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

However he got up again, and taking his Sword in his hand, ſaid to <hi>Birmartes,</hi> who had already turn'd his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: <hi>Knight, alight, and GOD forbid, that I ſhould twice, thro' my hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes fault, loſe the Right of my Enterpriſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Birmartes</hi> ſat foot to ground, and embracing his Shield, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan between them ſo fierce a Fight, that for the ſpace of an hour or more, it could hardly be judged, who would have the better or the worſe. But at the end the Vnknown Knight was ſo out of breath, that he was forc't to retreat a little back. Which <hi>Birmartes</hi> ſeeing, ſaid to him: <hi>Indeed, Sir Knight, you take an ill way to make me confeſs ſo great a Lye, as you ere-while bragg'd, you would: Are you already ſo tired?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other, very much vext at this mockery, thus anſwered him: <hi>Sir Knight, you ſhall know preſently.</hi> And lifting up his Arm, gave <hi>Birmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> ſuch a blow with his Sword that his eyes ſparkled, and their fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan again ſo fierce, that ſometimes Fortune was judg'd to be for the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Knight, and ſometimes for <hi>Birmartes.</hi> Nevertheleſs the end was ſuch, that <hi>Birmartes</hi> gain'd the Victory, and the other fell upon the field, ſo tired, that he was quite ſpent.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Birmartes</hi> caſt himſelf lightly upon him, and plucking off his Helmet, perceived that 'twas his Brother <hi>Olorius:</hi> at which much diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, as fearing him to be worſe than he was, he ſaid to him: <hi>Sir Knight, 'tis probable that the Fault of your Miſtreſſes Beauty, and not your want of Proweſs, is the cauſe, of what has befallen you: for otherwiſe (ſeeing what I have found in you) 'tis certain, that I ſhould not ſo lightly have parted out of your hands, as I have done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Olorius,</hi> hearing him ſpeak with ſo much humility, altho' he was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcontented, thus anſwered him: <hi>As GOD help me, Knight, I can give you no very good Account of my Miſtreſſes Beauty: for I never ſaw her:
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:154293:111"/> But I ſhould have conſidered, what is in you, before my undertaking any thing, at leaſt to avoid the ſhame, I undergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he got up, and gave <hi>Birmartes</hi> his hand to help him: for he was very much wounded: nor was <hi>Birmartes</hi> much leſs. Wherefore retiring, the one into the Town, and the other into his Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>BIrmartes</hi> then being cured, and reſolving to begin again his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, there entered into his Pavilion a Damſel, accompany'd by an Eſquire, who carried a Casket, cloſely wrapt up This Damſel Saluted <hi>Birmartes</hi> with great Courteſy, and untying the Packet, preſented him with a Suit of Armor, as red as blood, and a Shield, having an Elm in a Field, <hi>Or,</hi> ſaying to him: Knight us'd to overcome, <hi>He, who loves you, and eſteems you, for the Proweſs that is in you, ſends you this Preſent: And ſends you word by me, that at this time you ſhall not know who he is: But ſo it is, that this Armor, which he has kept for you, will do you more Service than you think for.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Damſel, my Friend,</hi> anſwered he, <hi>I humbly thank the perſon, who has had ſo good a Remembrance of me, and eſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And that very day he acquainted the Kings, and the other Lords, that he ſhould be in a readineſs, if any one will defend the Honour of his Miſtreſſes Beauty. Wherefore going forth of the Town, they went to the Place appointed, with a great Number of People, whither they were no ſooner come, but they perceived a Knight of great Stature, riding towards them, mounted on a Roan Horſe, his Armor being <hi>Azure,</hi> covered with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:154293:111"/> Stars, and his Shield of the ſame. In his hand he held a great Lance, which he reſted on his Thigh with ſuch a Grace, that nothing could exceed it. And to the top of his Helmet was faſtned the Portraiture of a Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, fair in all Perfection.</p>
               <p>In this Equipage did he paſs before the Scaffold, on which the Kings were ſitting, whom he ſaluted w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>thout diſcovering himſelf; and approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Birmartes,</hi> ſaid to him loud enough: <hi>Knight, you muſt grant me, that ſhe, whom you love, no way equals the Lady, whoſe Figure I bear; elſe your Head ſhall do me reaſon, as a Puniſhment of your audacious folly in compairing her to a Lady, to whom ſhe deſerves not to be ſo much as a ſervant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Birmartes,</hi> much diſpleas'd to hear himſelf threatned, and his Lady inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, thus anſwered: <hi>Truly, good Sir, you ſpeak very gloriouſly, and my ſtay in this place would have been too much in vain, if I ſhould, for your Threats, confeſs ſo great a lye: But I hope, before you get from me, to chaſtiſe you in ſuch a manner, that you ſhall be an Example to thoſe, that may come hereafter. And as to my head, I ſhall keep it better, than you will do yours, as will be ſeen by the Event.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then they parted to fetch their Carreer, and ran againſt each other with ſuch Fury, that they both fell to the Ground, where they lay ſome time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtirring either hand or foot. And every one began to think them dead, when they got up again, embracing their Shields, and taking their Swords in their hands. Then they began ſo fierce a Fight, that the ſound of their Blows would have made one think, there had been above twenty Knights in Battle, and the Sparks of fire flew in ſuch quantity from their Armor, that the Iron, taken out of the Furnace, and beaten on the Anvil, yields no greater Luſtre. But what need is there to number their Blows for the Embelliſhment of our Hiſtory? They charg'd each other with ſo much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, that, had it not been for the Goodneſs of their Armor, they had ſoon made an End of the Combat, with the loſs of both their Lives. But ſeeing that their Swords could not enter, they clos'd body to body, doing their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to bring each other to the Ground. In which they profited as little as before tho' they cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nevertheleſs they ſoon after knew the contrary: For the two Combatants return'd again to take their Swords, and as if they had done nothing all the day, began again their fight more ſharp and dangerous than before. And nevertheleſs, either for the temper of their Armor, or the thickneſs and goodneſs of them, neither of them could draw the leaſt drop of blood from his Adverſary.</p>
               <p>At which they both wondred, and principally the Knight of the Stars,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:154293:112"/> who ſaid to the other: As far as I ſee, Knight, we toil all day without gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any Advantage, one over the other, ſince our Swords cut no better: therefore, pray, let us diſarm our ſelves, and to put a more ſpeedy end to this beginning, let us take only Sword and Cloak: for had I thought of what is fallen out, I ſhould have entered otherwiſe into Fight againſt you.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Birmartes</hi> heard this Diſcourſe, he very much wondred at his Enemies great Courage, and immediatly doubted, that 'twas he, with whom he had to do upon the Sea, when they were part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Well then,</hi> ſaid the Knight of the Stars, <hi>I thought to have done you a Pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then they had before been very careful to do their Duties, they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſhew themſelves yet more earneſt, altho' they apparently grew hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, having already continu'd above five hours without any reſt: And moreover the Heat of the day was to extreme, that he, who was lighteſt cloath'd, did perpetually ſweat. Which mov'd King <hi>Amadis</hi> to ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, ſeeing them ſuffer and endure ſo much, that he could not forbear ſaying to the others: <hi>On my conſcience 'tis great Pity to let two of the beſt Knights in the world dye, who are ſo animated one againſt the other, that the Conqueror will never pardon the Weaker,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs he of the Stars gain'd ground by little and little; whence with gayety of heart, ſhaking his Sword, he cry'd out: <hi>Ha! Knight, now I have thee in ſuch a place, that neither by putting out the Torches, nor by force, we can be ſeparated: and thou ſhalt pay for the fooliſh words, thou wouldſt have maintain'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſaid this, he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eſs'd him cloſer, than he had yet done. Then <hi>Birmartes</hi> knew by his threats, that he had indeed ſuſpected aright, it being the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> to whom the Damſel, that he met near <hi>Rome,</hi> preſented the Harneſs, he now were when he was within a days journey of <hi>Naples,</hi> without declaring from whom; and left him to go to <hi>Birmartes</hi> with the Vermilion Arms, as you have been told.

               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:154293:112"/>
               <p>To return then to our Knights, <hi>Birmartes</hi> hearing, with whom he had to do, his heart ſo ſwell'd, that he thus anſwer'd the <hi>Knight of the Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sword: by my head 'tis a great Pleaſure to me to know, who thou art, that I may have more occaſion to abate thy Arrogance, nor do thou think, that thou haſt any Advantage over me: For before the Game is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, thou ſhalt find, that I am better able to revenge my ſelf, than thou to threaten.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſaid this word, he ruſht upon the other, and ſtruck him ſo fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the top of his Helmet, that he conſtrain'd him to put his knee to the ground: but he ſoon got up again, and in revenge gave his Adverſary ſuch a blow in the ſame place, that his two hands ſerv'd him for a ſupport on the Graſs, tho' he made there no long ſtay, but reſettling his Helmet, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan again better than before: not but there was always diſcern'd ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Advantage on the ſide of the <hi>Knight of the burning ſword.</hi> And indeed he was deſcended of the moſt illuſtrious and glorious blood at that day on the Earth, having to his great Grand father King <hi>Amadis,</hi> who conſidering that, if he let them Fight any longer, the Death of the other was near, ſaid to the three Kings, which were ſitting by him, that 'twas better to go and pray them to part, ſeeing the great Loſs, there would be in loſing them.</p>
               <p>Which they approv'd, and going down from their Scaffolds, went to the two Knights, who at their coming drew back, and King <hi>Amadis,</hi> and the King of <hi>Sicily</hi> addreſs'd themſelves to the <hi>Knight of the burning ſword,</hi> to whom they ſaid: <hi>Knight, be pleas'd to do ſo much for our ſakes, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no farther in this Combat: for 'tis not reaſonable, that two ſuch gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant men, as you are, ſhould dye on ſo ſmall an occaſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He, who preſently thought, that by refuſing ſo courteous a Requeſt, made him by ſuch Perſons, as they were, particularly by the Father of her, whom he lov'd better than his own ſoul, he might be blam'd, thus anſwered them: <hi>For certain, my Lords, 'tis grievous for me to retire thus, nevertheleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to obey you in all things, let us know, what mine Enemy thinks of it, againſt whom I am the moſt unfortunate Knight, that ever was: for this is now the ſecond time, that he has eſcap'd from me, with more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, than I deſire.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>I aſſure you,</hi> ſaid King <hi>Amadis, that he will do, what he ſhall be reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to by the Kings of</hi> Naples <hi>and</hi> Sardinia: Who in the mean time was perſwading <hi>Birmartes</hi> to conſent to the ſame.</p>
               <p>To which he willingly gave ear, knowing he had the worſt, altho' he bravely conceal'd, what he thought of it. And for this Cauſe he ſaid to them: <hi>My Lords, the Quarrel be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So they led him into his Pavilion, leaving the King of great <hi>Britain,</hi> and <hi>Alpatracy</hi> with the other, whom <hi>Amadis</hi> indeed thought to be the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword,</hi> and had already acquainted the King of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> with his Suſpicion, of which, that he might know the Truth, he made <hi>Alpatracy</hi> a ſign with his Eye to ask him, who therefore thus ſpake to the Knight: <hi>I deſire you Sir of Courteſy to tell me your Name: For I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect you to be a Gentleman, whom I greatly love and eſteem: And if you are the ſame, you would be to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore he thus anſwered the King: <hi>Sir I know not, what Love you bear me, nor whom you think me to be; but if you wiſh me any Good, 'tis not altogether without Reaſon; ſince I have all my Life deſired to do Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to You, and ſuch as You are.

                  <hi>In good faith,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>he is nam'd the</hi> Knight of the burning Sword, <hi>and I well believe, that you are none of he: For he would never concel himſelf from me.</hi>

                  <hi>Certainly, Sir</hi> anſwer'd he, <hi>'tis not long, ſince I left him, and I am ſo much his Friend, that I deſire you for his ſake to tell me, what it is, that King</hi> Amadis <hi>has done for him in</hi> Saba, <hi>to the end, that, if I find him again, he may have News of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Alpatracy</hi> related to him at large, how Queen <hi>Buruca</hi> had been accus'd, and what became of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ah!</hi> ſaid the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword,</hi> in the mean time within himſelf; <hi>Traytor</hi> Maudan! <hi>the Gods have had too much pity of you! for without toiling ſuch a Prince, you deſerv'd an Halter.</hi>

               <p>Ah! my great Friend, <hi>anſwer'd he:</hi> I was thinking to leave this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, for to go into <hi>Saba</hi> to find the King, for ſome News, I have this day heard, which touches me very near. And on the other ſide, I am forc'd to break this Enterpriſe, being call'd this way to an Affair, on
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:154293:114"/> which my Honor depends: Thus I ſee my ſelf between two Extremities and know not which I ſhould chooſe for the beſt.</p>

               <p>Moſt High, moſt Mighty, and moſt Excellent Prince, if future things were as preſent to men, as they are unknown to them, there would be few Perſons deceiv'd, and fewer Wicked, that could deceive them by giving them falſe Intelligence: But ſuch a ſecret being out of our Power, we ſhould (certainly) more fear this malice of men, than Death it ſelf, which can deceive us but once. For that, to which theſe Traitors and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains lead us, takes not only away the Life, but the immortal Honour, which every Perſon of Virtue may acquire, blacking his Reputation and Honour by ſhameful and lying Stories, with which they feed the ears of thoſe, who hear them. And of this (victorious King) your Majeſty can better judge, than any other, having been upon the Point of being reputed an unjuſt King, by your intending to put the Queen to Death, for the falſe Accuſation, made of her and your loyal ſubject and ſervant, the <hi>Knight of the Burning Sword.</hi> Not, Sir, that I will excuſe my ſelf of the Fault, I committed, in abſenting my ſelf from your Court according to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel given me by <hi>Maudan:</hi> for where my Innocence was, Puniſhment could have no place. And moreover, inſtead of leaving my honour doubtful by my Flight, I ſhould rather (knowing your Vertue and my Juſtice) ſubmit my ſelf to your Chaſtiſement, than fearing your Fury, and ſhunning death, which I deſerv'd not, render my ſelf thus ſuſpected of Guilt. Now the Gods, as far, as I underſtand, have permitted, that the Truth has ſince been diſcover'd by the ſame Perſon, who had conceal'd it, and the Queens honour and mine reſtor'd by the invincible Proweſs of <hi>Amadis,</hi> King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> who, ſuſtaining my Right, has in your Majeſty's Preſence ſlain the Traitor in the plain Field of Battle. And nevertheleſs, Sir, if there remains in you any ſpark of Diſpleaſure againſt your humble ſervant, I beſeeech you to forget it, and give me part in your good grace, till ſuch time as I have opportunity to return to your Majeſty, which I ſhould have
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:154293:114"/> already done, had it not been for the Promiſe, I have made theſe Kings, here aſſembled, not to leave them, till the War, they have undertaken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt two other Traitors, is at an end. Wherefore you will be pleaſed to excuſe me, who in all humility kiſs your Majeſties hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Letter being thus written, made up, and well ſeal'd, he delivered it to the Damſel, whom he took aſide, and ſaid to her:</hi> Damſel my Friend, ſince you will do me the favour, to go for me to King <hi>Magadan,</hi> I beſeech you, in preſenting to him this Letter, to tell him the occaſion of my ſtay in theſe Parts: and that, as ſoon as I ſhall have an Opportunity, I will not fail to repair to him, and preſent him with my ſervice, as I am bound. You will ſee alſo the Queen and Prince <hi>Fulurtin,</hi> to whom alſo I deſire you to give my moſt humble Reſpects.</p>
               <p>Sir, <hi>anſwerd ſhe,</hi> I will not fail to do, what you command me; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Departure I will acquaint you, that the arms I preſented you was ſent you by the Sage <hi>Alquif,</hi> who loves you, and honours you more, than any Knight he knows. He has charged me to tell you, that your father is a <hi>Greek</hi> by Nation, and that you are the Iſſue of a moſt Illuſtrious Blood, and herewith content your ſelf: for I can tell you no more, except it be that he ſends you word, that before your Departure from <hi>Italy,</hi> you ſhall recover one of the things, you held moſt for loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Knight of the burning Sword <hi>was much amaz'd, &amp; more rejoyc'd when he underſtood, that he was a Gentleman of Great Parentage, and imbracing her, who brought him this good News, ſaid to her:</hi> Alas! my great Friend, for Gods ſake tell me then my Fathers Name, if you know it: For 'tis the greateſt Deſire, I have in this world.</p>
               <p>Aſſure your ſelf, <hi>anſwer'd ſhe,</hi> if I knew it, it ſhould not be conceal'd from you.</p>

                  <hi>This ſaid, ſhe took leave of him, and embarkt; the Knight intreating her, that ſhe would find Means to bring him back an Anſwer with all poſſible Speed.

               <argument>
                  <p>How News came to the Kings, being at <hi>Naples,</hi> of the great Preparation, made by the Uſurper of the Empire, to come and give them Battle at <hi>Friuli:</hi> And of the Rancounter, they had with the King of <hi>Metz.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> pretending, as you have heard, to the Kingdom of <hi>Metz,</hi> had ordinarily ſpies in the Parts of <hi>Gaul,</hi> by whom (eight or ten dayes after the Fight, between the two good Knights <hi>Birmartes</hi> and <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> ſurnamed formerly the <hi>Knight of the burning Sword</hi>) he was advertiz'd that the Vſurper of the Empire, with his Forces, was, to come and joyn the King of <hi>Metz</hi> in the plain of <hi>Verona,</hi> and there to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect King <hi>Amadis</hi> and his Army. Now the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was ally'd to King <hi>Amadis,</hi> and with all his might ſupported the Party of the Empreſs his Daughter, ſo that with ſix thouſand fighting Men he hindred, as much as poſſibly he could, the King of <hi>Metz,</hi> who intended to paſs thro' the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Suitzerland,</hi> from executing his Deſigns: For he always coaſted him, often conſtraining him to ſtay longer in a place, than he deſired. This was in part the Cauſe, that the Army of theſe Kings, aſſembled at <hi>Naples,</hi> went to look for them in <hi>Germany,</hi> and there to give them Battle: For which purpoſe 'twas proclaim'd in their Camp, that every one ſhould make himſelf ready to remove the eighth day following.</p>
               <p>During this Time there arriv'd from <hi>Spain</hi> ſeven thouſand good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Knights, which King <hi>Brian</hi> ſent by the Duke of <hi>Merida</hi> to their Aſſiſtance, of whom <hi>Olorius</hi> had the Command. They then being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, <hi>Amadis,</hi> ſeeing he had no News of the Army, he had ſent to raiſe in Great <hi>Britain,</hi> reſolved notwithſtanding to march with his Forces ſtrait to <hi>Aquileja,</hi> and thence to <hi>Marcadi Ancona,</hi> coaſting always the <hi>Venetian,</hi> Sea, for the greater Convenience in having Proviſions, till he came to <hi>Verona,</hi> where he had Advice, that the King of <hi>Metz</hi> was marching, into <hi>Germany</hi> for to get into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and would there entrench himſelf, expecting the Emperors Forces. Then theſe Lords aſſembled in Counſel, and reſolved to go and meet him, before the Emperor was got to him: Wherefore they remov'd on the morrow by break of day, and made ſuch haſt, that they got into the Mountains, before the King of <hi>Metz</hi> was aware of it, and ſurpriz'd him ſo ſhort, that they preſented him the Battle, as it were on the ſudden.</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:154293:115"/>
               <p>Now he had with him a good Body of Horſe, and a great Number of Foot, which the Count of <hi>Armignac,</hi> and the Dukes of <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Brabant</hi> had brought thither, with ſome <hi>Germans</hi> out of Order. The Skirmiſh was on both ſides very fair, and the Fight at laſt ſo fierce, that by the help of <hi>Birmartes, Florelus,</hi> and <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> who came thither unknown, the King of <hi>Metz</hi> was diſcomfited, himſelf and the Ea l <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mignac</hi> ſlain, together with the Duke of <hi>Savona,</hi> and his Son: So that had it not been for the favor of the Night, which ſeparated them, the Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the reſt flying into the thickeſt part of a great Foreſt, there had not a Man of them eſcap'd. Then were <hi>Amadis</hi>'s People conſtrain'd to retire for the Darkneſs, and lodg'd in their Enemies Camp, keeping a good Watch; for they were told that the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> was rallying to come and find them again the next day.</p>

               </p>
               <p>There was not any one in the Company, who did not willingly give Ear to this Counſel, and the Duke himſelf was choſen by all to go to the King of <hi>Sicilies</hi> Camp, and carry him this Meſſage. By Means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, aſſoon as the Dawning of the Day began to appear, he took Horſe, and accompany'd by the Principal Perſons of the Kingdom of <hi>Metz,</hi> came to the Kings Tent, whither they were conducted by thoſe of the Watch, who found him, as he was arming himſelf. And already were the Souldiers putting themſelves in <hi>Battalla</hi> to go and proſecute their foregoing Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: But all was ſtay'd vy the coming of this new Ambaſſy, which being heard by <hi>Alpatracy,</hi> and the other Princes and Lords of the Army, the Offers, they preſented, were accepted, the Accord concluded, and Peace ſecur'd: And before Dinner <hi>Alpatracy</hi> was thro' all the Army proclaim'd King of <hi>Metz</hi> and <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperor, who was that day come to the City of <hi>Conſtance</hi> with his Army, was ſoon advertiz'd of this, wherefore he made haſt to hinder the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:154293:116"/> from paſſing any farther. But they met the eighth day after in the Evening, and the Skirmiſh began in a Village, where each of the two Armies deſign'd to take up their Quarters. There many good Knights on both ſides ended their dayes, and had not the Night at that time favor'd the King of <hi>Sicilies</hi> Party, the <hi>Germans</hi> had gotten the Victory. But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune turn'd the next day: For <hi>Birmartes, Amadis</hi> of <hi>Greece, Olorious, Don Florelus, Orizenes</hi> and <hi>Bravatus,</hi> Sons to the Queens <hi>Calafia,</hi> and <hi>Pintequineſtra,</hi> drew up, and being accompany'd with many good Knights and Souldiers, aſſoon as they could ſee, whom to ſtrike, fiercely ſet upon their Enemies. Now whilſt they were in the Head of the Fight, there came an Expreſs to the Emperour, which brought him News, that the City of <hi>Mentz</hi> was taken by aſſault, the Garriſon put to the Sword, and the Widow of the deceas'd Emperor taken out of the Priſon, to which ſhe had been confin'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And believe it, Sir</hi> ſaid the Meſſenger, <hi>that all this has been done by the Earl of</hi> Flanders: <hi>For I ſaw him there, accompany'd by above two thouſand Knights.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This News indeed did not much pleaſe the Emperor, nor thoſe, that heard it: and the Rumor of it ran ſo thro' all the Camp, that many (even the moſt part) lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

But the Emperors Death ſtruck ſuch a Terror into his Army, that they were immediatly diſcomfited, and turning their backs, fled with all ſpeed towards <hi>Conſtance,</hi> where they inclos'd themſelves, leaving behind them above ten thouſand dead in the Field. And that very night was the City beſieg'd, which, being briskly aſſaulted the next day, and as well defended, could not be taken till the fourth Aſſault, when it was Seal'd, and <hi>Amadis</hi>'s Troops got into it by force, putting all they found in it to the Sword, without ſparing any living ſoul.

               <p>YOV have been told, if you remember, how <hi>Guillan,</hi> Duke of <hi>Briſtow,</hi> and <hi>Angriote d' Eſtravaux,</hi> great Maſter of the Realm of Great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> accompany'd by the Duke of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and a great Number of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, Knights, Eſquires, and Soldiers, embarkt near <hi>London,</hi> and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Command of the King their Maſter, made ſtrait towards <hi>Naples,</hi> where he was getting together a great Army, for to recover the State of the Empire, and revenge the Death of the murther'd Emperor, and his Son-in-law <hi>Dinerpius.</hi> They had a very fair wind for four days together: but on the fifth there aroſe ſuch a Tempeſt, that there was left them neither Maſt, Sail, nor Rope, they could make uſe of: So that, whether they would or no, they were driven on the Coaſt of <hi>Flanders,</hi> where they took Port, as well for the repairing of their Veſſels, as to reſt themſelves a little after the Toil, they had ſuffer'd.</p>
